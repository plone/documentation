"Click \"Current folder\" in the left side of the panel, if it isn't already "

" editing -- all pages are contained inside some folder. There are many ways "
"to manage storage of images, including having one central images folder, but"
" a common method is to store images that show on a page in the folder that "
"contains the page (the current folder). In this method, pages and the images"
" associated with them are stored together within the folder structure. If "
"you click the Upload button, you will be prompted to select an image on your"
" computer and upload it. After selecting an image to upload, the right panel"
" will let you give the image a title for use on the web site, and several "
"image placement and sizing options. Clicking OK will upload the image and "
"place it on the page. The same panel will appear if you click an image on "
"page to select it, then click the same \"tree\" icon for editing the image "
"options or for changing the image. You are responsible for sizing and "
"editing images on your computer before you upload them, but one easy way to "
"handle images for use on most web pages is to make a copy of an image on "
"your computer, then resize it to something like 1000 pixels in largest "
"dimension. This is a reasonable size for uploading -- there is no need to "
"upload your gargantuan images coming from your digital camera. Plone will "
"automatically create several sizes of an uploaded image, including "
"\"large,\" \"mini,\" and other sizes. You pick the size you want to use when"
" your upload or edit the image with the \"tree\" icon. You can also override"
" the image size choice by editing the HTML."
