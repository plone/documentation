"Simply put, any Zope object can acquire any object or property from any of "
"its parents. That is, if you have a folder called *A*, containing two "
"resources (a document called *homepage* and another folder called *B*), then"
" an URL pointing at `http://.../A/B/homepage` would work even though *B* is "
"empty. This is because Zope starts to look for *homepage* in *B*, doesn't "
"find it, and goes back up to *A*, where it's found. The reality, inevitably,"
" is more complex than this. For the whole story, see the `Acquisition "
