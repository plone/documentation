"On first glance, there is quite a lot going on here, but it is not so hard "
"to understand. First, we define a good old-fashioned Zope 2 factory and ZMI "
"add form. This is good practice, because PAS plug-ins can be managed via "
"*acl\\_users* in the ZMI. If you find yourself wandering there, however, "
"remember to bring a torch and keep a trail of breadcrumbs to find your way "
"out. A backup wouldn't hurt either if you try to change things. It is, "
"unfortunately, not the most intuitive of interfaces. We will see how the "
"plug-in is registered and activated in a moment, but first notice that the "
"plug-in implements an interface, *ILocalRolesPlugin*,Â  which is defined by "
"PlonePAS, the PAS-in-Plone integration layer. This defines methods that will"
" be called by the PAS machinery to determine, in this case, local roles. "
"Note that this is *not* an adapter (perhaps it would have been if PAS had "
"been invented in Zope 3, though Zope 3 has its own authentication machinery "
"that is evolved from PAS and works slightly differently). When created, the "
"*ProjectLocalRoleManager* is an Zope 2 object that lives in the ZODB in "
"*acl\\_users*. The methods of the *ILocalRolesPlugin* interface are fairly "
"self-explanatory in purpose. They allow PAS to extract the local roles for a"
" particular user in a particular context (*getRolesInContext()*), to check "
"whether a user in fact has one of the roles required to access a particular "
"method attribute in a particular context (*checkLocalRolesAllowed()*), and "
"to get a map of users-to-roles in a particular context. The complex parts "
"are, as often is the case, concerned with acquistion. The helper method "
"*\\_findWorkspace()* attempts to walk up the object hierarchy to find the "
"first possible *IWorkspace* (it will only consider one) to get hold of the "
"appropriate *IWorkspace* adapter that is then used to determine the actual "
"roles that apply, as above. Without walking up the content hierarchy, it "
"would not be possible to let the local roles of a particular project apply "
"when in the context of a piece of content *inside* that project (i.e. a sub-"
"object of the folderish *Project* object). There is some reasonably hairy "
"acqusition-juggling going on in the \\_*chain()* method to return this chain"
" as a generator. The hairiness comes from the fact that the thing that is "
"being checked may in fact be a method that is being accessed, and aqusition "
"chains can get themselves in all kinds of knots, especially when Five is in "
"the mix. Lastly, we need to declare a *ClassSecurityInfo* and call "
"*InitializeClass* to get Zope 2 to play ball."

"The last issue is what happens with view() and \\_\\_call\\_\\_() in this "

"and this is still the default fallback, but if the \"(Default)\" alias is "

"however: From the comments in the source code and the behaviour in Zope, "
"where \\_\\_call\\_\\_() is the last fallback if neither "
"\\_\\_browser\\_default\\_\\_() nor index\\_html are found, and to ensure "
"that the \"view() --> \\_\\_call\\_\\_()\" mechanism always returns the "
"object itself, never dumped file content, it seems to be the intention that "
"\\_\\_call\\_\\_() should always return the object, never a default-page or "
"file content dumped via an index\\_html() method. For \\*Folders\\* in Plone"
" 2.0, this was actually not the case: \\_\\_call\\_\\_() would look up the "
"'view' action, which was \"string:${object\\_url}\", which with the use of "
"\\_\\_browser\\_default\\_\\_() resulted in a lookup of a default-page if "
"one was present. With the CMF 1.5 behaviour, the use of the \"(Default)\" "
"alias in \\_\\_call\\_\\_() will mean that calling a File returns the dumped"
" file content. Calling a Folder will return the default-page (or the Folder "
"in its view if no default page is set) as in Plone 2.0. The behaviour in "
"Plone 2.1 is that \\_\\_call\\_\\_(), as overridden in BrowserDefaultMixin, "
"should always return the object itself as it would be rendered in Plone "
"without any index\\_html or default-page magic. Hence, \\_\\_call\\_\\_() in"
" CMFDynamicViewFTI looks up the \"(selected layout)\" target and resolves "
"this. This behaviour is thus consistent with the old behaviour of Documents "
"and Files, but whereas Folders with a default-page in 2.0 used to return "
"that default page from \\_\\_call\\_\\_(), in 2.1, it returns the Folder "
"itself rendered in its selected layout. Again remember that this method will"
" rarely if ever be called, since /path/to/object is intercepted by CMF's "
"pre-traversal hook and ends up looking up the \"(Default)\" method alias "
"(which \\*does\\* honour default-page for Folders), and /path/to/object/view"
" uses the \"view\" method alias, as described above."
