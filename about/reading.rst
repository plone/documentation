Reading the documentation
=========================

.. contents:: :local:

Web
===

The easiest way for reading these documentation is online on http://docs.plone.org

Offline
=======

If you used to use `Dash <http://kapeli.com/dash>`_ or `Zeal <http://zealdocs.org/download.html>`_, you can do that for `Plone <https://plone.org>`_ too. We have compiled docsets for Plone 3 and Plone 4.

Dash
----

.. note:: If you have already installed the **old** Plone 4 docset via the community repository in Dash, please remove it, we do not support this anymore.

In order to get the docsets into Dash you have to subscribe to our *docset feed*.

        - start Dash
        - bla
        - bla

        todo: add picture here

Zeal
----

If you use Zeal [on Ubuntu for example], you have to subscribe to our *docset feed*.

        - start Zeal
        - go to Edit -> Options -> Docsets -> Add feed
        - enter Feed URL: http://docs.plone.org/plone4.xml
        - click on OK

.. note:: If you want to subscribe to the docs of Plone 3, please enter
        Feed URL: http://docs.plone.org/plone3.xml

Docker
======

If you prefer to run the docs, locally for online/offline usage you can just pull our container from docker.hub

        todo: link to plone docs on docker hub.

If you use docker we assume that you know how to run a docker container.
