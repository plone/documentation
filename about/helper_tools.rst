**ReText** is a handy editor for **.rst** and **.md** formats.
On Ubuntu and Debian-based systems all you have to do is

.. code-block:: rst

   apt-get install retext


**Sublime Text** has a number of plugins for rst highlighting and snippets, install via the Sublime package installer.


**Emacs** has a nice `rst-mode
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html>`_. This mode comes
with some Emacs distros. Try ``M-x rst-mode`` in your Emacs and enjoy syntax
coloration, underlining a heading with ``^C ^A``

Another nice tool for Emacs is `Flycheck <https://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

**Eclipse** users can install **ReST Editor** through the Eclipse
Marketplace.

**Vim** does syntax highlighting for RST files.
There is also a nice plugin with enhanced functionalities called `Riv <https://github.com/Rykka/riv.vim>`_.

If you have a lot of existing documentation, you may want to check out `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ , the "swiss army knife" of document conversions.
