Custom Content Types
====================

The recommended way to develop new custom content types is by using :term:`Dexterity`. You'll find the full manual here.

Up until Plone 4.1, the standard way was to use :term:`Archetypes`.
You can still develop using Archetypes, and they will remain functional.
For any **new** development, Dexterity is strongly recommended.

The Archetypes reference manual will remain available at the `Plone 4 documentention <http://docs.plone.org/4/en/old-reference-manuals/archetypes/index.html>`_
