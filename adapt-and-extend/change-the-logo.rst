Change the Logo
===============

How to substitute the standard Plone logo with your own logo - a
through-the-web approach.

The Basics
----------

In Plone 3 and 4, the logo is simply an image with a link to the home
page of your site wrapped around it (there's just one small difference
between versions, the name is logo.jpg in Plone 3, logo.png in Plone 4).

::

    <a id="portal-logo" href="http://[your site]" accesskey="1">
        <img width="252" height="57" title="Plone" alt="" src="http://[your site]/logo.jpg"/>
    </a>

If you're happy with this approach, then you won't need to touch the
HTML as all the attributes in this snippet are generated automatically.
Follow the instructions in Section 1: Changing the Image and its Title.

If you just want to tweak the styles a little bit, then go to Section 2:
Changing the portal\_logo style.

If you would rather deliver your logo in a different fashion and need to
rewrite the HTML, then you can do this by customizing the logo template,
follow the instructions in Section 3: Changing the HTML.

1. Changing the Image and its Title
-----------------------------------

The logo image - logo.jpg (Plone 3) logo.png (Plone 4) - can be found in
the plone\_images folder in portal\_skins. The quickest way to replace
this is simply to upload your own image and give it the same name:

-  Go to the Zope Management Interface (Site Setup > Zope Management
   Interface)
-  Go to portal\_skins > plone\_images
-  Click logo.jpg (Plone 3) or logo.png (Plone 4) and then click the
   customize button
-  Now replace the image by clicking the browse button and choosing your
   own image from your file system
-  Edit the Title field (this will ensure that the title attribute
   changes in the HTML)
-  Save your changes and refresh your browser to see the changes on your
   site


2. Changing the portal\_logo style
----------------------------------

There are no styles set for *#portal-logo*, but there are some for
*#portal-logo img* in basic.css. Use the Firebug extension for Firefox
to investigate these. The simplest approach is to override these with
your own styles in ploneCustom.css.

-  Go to the Zope Management Interface (Site Setup > Zope Management
   Interface)
-  Make sure you have debug mode / development mode turned on in the CSS
   Registry (portal\_css)
-  Click portal\_skins > plone\_styles > ploneCustom.css and then click
   the Customize button
-  You will now have an editable version of ploneCustom.css in the
   custom folder of portal\_skins
-  Add your own styles here, click Save, and refresh your browser to see
   the changes

3. Changing the HTML
--------------------

The HTML for the logo is generated by logo.pt - a page template which is
part of a viewlet called plone.logo. To customize this through the web,
you'll need to use portal\_view\_customizations.

-  Go to the portal\_view\_customizations in the Zope Management
   Interface (Site Setup > Zope Management Interface)

-  Click plone.logo and then click the Customize button
-  You'll now have a template you can rewrite - we've highlighted the
   significant bits in the theory section below and given you a couple
   of examples to get you started.
-  Save your changes and refresh your browser to see them

**Note**: if you want to go back and make further changes later, you'll
see that plone.logo is highlighted in the portal\_view\_customizations
list, click on it to edit it. If you want to remove your customizations
completely, use the contents tab of portal\_view\_customizations, tick
the box next to your template and click Delete.

The Theory
~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the logo.pt template. It is written in the templating language
used by Plone - TAL (or ZPT). It helps to know this (and it doesn't take
long to learn), but we'll talk you through this example:

::

    <a metal:define-macro="portal_logo"
       id="portal-logo"
       accesskey="1"
       tal:attributes="href view/navigation_root_url"
       i18n:domain="plone">
        <img src="logo.jpg" alt=""
             tal:replace="structure view/logo_tag" />
    </a>

First we have the link tag:

You can disregard *metal:define-macro="portal\_logo"*\ this is just
wrapping the code into something that can be re-used again if necessary.

The important bit is *tal:attributes="href view/navigation\_root\_url"*,
this is the code that supplies your site URL to the href attribute.

There is a magic variable here, *view/navigation\_root\_url,*\ that
seems to have appeared from nowhere. In fact, *view* is a collection of
properties computed by the plone.logo viewlet and seamlessly passed to
the logo.pt template. Here are the available properties:

 navigation\_root\_url
    supplies the URL of your site (it could potentially be something
    different if you've set up a different navigation root)
 logo\_tag
    looks up the name of the logo image from base\_properties, finds the
    image, collects its dimensions and title and turns all of this into
    an HTML image tag with the appropriate attributes Check back to the
    alternative approach in Section 1 of this How To for more
    information about base\_properties.
 portal\_title
    looks up and supplies the title of your site

Now look at the image tag in the template.

The key here is *tal:replace="structure view/logo\_tag"*. This means
that the template won't deliver the image tag actually written out here,
instead, it will **replace the whole thing** with the tag generated by
the plone.logo viewlet. If you don't want this to happen, then you
should delete this line.

Note: *structure* means treat the value as HTML rather than a text
string.

Example 1: A plain text title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a customized version of the template, using *view/portal\_title*
rather than *view/logo\_tag*, to give you a text header instead (if
you've used Plone 2, then you might recognize this):

::

    <h1 metal:define-macro="portal_logo"
       id="portal-logo">
       <a accesskey="1"
       tal:attributes="href view/navigation_root_url"
       i18n:domain="plone" tal:content="view/portal_title">
        </a>
    </h1>

Of course you'll want to supply your own styles, look back at Section 2
of this How To for information on defining these in ploneCustom.css. You
could adjust this example to use an accessible image replacement
technique in your CSS.

Example 2: Supplying your own image tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You don't have to use logo\_tag if you don't want to:

::

    <a metal:define-macro="portal_logo"
       id="portal-logo"
       accesskey="1"
       tal:attributes="href view/navigation_root_url"
       i18n:domain="plone">
        <img src="[My logo ID]" alt="[My Logo]"
             width="[My Width]" height="[My Height]" 
             tal:attributes="title view/portal_title" />
    </a>

You will, of course, need to upload your own logo to the custom folder
in portal\_skins, see the instructions in Section 1 of this How To.

Further Information
-------------------

-  There are further How Tos in the Logo section of the Plone
   documentation dealing with more advanced customization methods.
-  More guidance on TAL and ZPT can be found in the ZPT tutorial.
-  If you want to transfer your changes to the file system in your own
   theme product, then proceed to the :doc:`viewlets overview section </develop/plone/views/viewlets>`.
