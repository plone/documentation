Theming Plone
=============

.. admonition:: Intro

   The current best-practice way to theme a Plone site is by using an engine called `"Diazo" <http://www.diazo.org>`_.
   This allows designers to design a theme in just plain, flat HTML, CSS (and JavaScript, if wanted) and then to hook that into the Plone backend to fill it with sophisticated content.

   The easiest way to do this is to use "plone.app.theming". But if you need to integrate Plone with other back-end servers, legacy systems, or any webservice, you can use Diazo to all combine it in a unified look & feel.

Using Diazo is also possible as a standalone service. Normally the Diazo theme transformation is running inside the Plone process. But you can compile the Diazo rules to low level XSLT and let a webserver
do the actual transformation, or run the Diazo transformations in a `WSGI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface>`_ enabled service.
If you want this advanced stand alone set up, please take a look at documentation on `www.diazo.org <http://www.diazo.org>`_, especially the
`Compilation <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/compiler.html>`_ and `Deployment <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/deployment.html>`_ chapters.

.. note ::

    Up to version 4.1, Plone was using an older style of theming. Using that is not considered *best practice* anymore.
    See `older versions of these docs <http://docs.plone.org/4/en/adapt-and-extend/theming/old_style_theming.html>`_ if you need the information.
