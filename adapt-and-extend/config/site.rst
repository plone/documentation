These settings should be changed for every site.

Site title
    The name of your website
Site Logo
    Upload your site logo. For extensive customization, you will want to create a special theme that will include your logo, but for a quick change this is enough.
Expose Dublin Core metadata
    This option allows information per content item, like Description, Tags, Author and others, to be shown to and ranked by search engines. It can help improve your search ranking, provided you fill in those fields with correct information.
Expose sitemap.xml.gz
    Almost always a good idea on a public website. It will make life for search engines easier, meaning they can better index your content.
JavaScript for web statistics support
    To gather information for web analytics like Piwik (an open source self-hosted option) or Google Analytics you can paste the required snippet of code here. Be aware that this can have legal implications ("cookie laws") in some countries.
Display publication date
    Show the date a content item was published in the byline.
Icon visibility
    Master control for enabling content type icons (Different icons for different types of content). Content type icons can be useful for content editors, but distracting for anonymous visitors.
    You can set it to show only for logged-in users, all users or none at all. If this option is set to none or logged-in users only it will override all other settings  in portlets or content item settings.
Thumb visibility
    Master control for enabling preview images (aka thumbs) in list views, tables views  or portlets.
    You can set it to show only for logged-in users, all users or none at all. If this option is set to none or logged-in users only it will override all related settings below as well those in individual portlet- or content item settings.


No Thumbs in portlets
   Suppress thumbs (preview images) in all portlets; this default can be overridden individually in selected portlets
No thumbs in list views
   Suppress thumbs in all list views; this default can be overriden individually
No thumbs in summary views
   Suppress thumbs in all summary views; this default can be overriden individually
No thumbs in table views
   Suppress thumbs in all tableviews and in folder contents view; this default can be overriden individually
Thumb scale for portlets
   Choose from a pull down populated by available scales defined in the :doc:`Image handling control panel<image-handling.rst>`. This default can be overriden individually
Thumb scale for listings
   E.g. for standard view; this default can be overriden individually
Thumb scale for tables
   E.g. for tabular view,  this default can be overriden individually. **This setting is also used for the folder content listing (can not be overridden).**
Thumb scale for summary view
   This default can be overriden individually
Toolbar position
    On modern wide-screen monitors, having the Toolbar to the side provides most usable space. But some people prefer it to be on the top of their screen.
Site based relative URL for toolbar Logo
    Customize the small logo on top of the toolbar, if you prefer. Note: this is not the same as the website logo.
robots.txt
    By convention, search engines look for a file called robots.txt to show them what they should index or not.
