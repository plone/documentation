From this screen you can see the most recent errors and *exceptions*.

Remember: not all 'exceptions' are harmful or indications of potential problems.
It can be that visitors just mis-typed a URL, or many other reasons.

But in case of trouble, or if you are trying to find out if your permissions are working correctly, this should be your first port of call.
