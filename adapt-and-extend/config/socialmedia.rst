Enabling this setting will add social media meta tags (Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter) to pages, so that when you share a Plone webpage on services like Facebook and Twitter, links and images will be better formatted.

.. note::

   This **does not** add any "sharing buttons", nor will it connect to the social media networks (often unacceptable in corporate or intranet settings). There is a variety of add-ons that provide this functionality.
