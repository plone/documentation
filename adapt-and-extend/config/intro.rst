Introduction and overview
=========================


This screen, which is available for the roles ``Site Admin`` and ``Manager``, is where you can configure most aspects of your website.

   :alt: Site setup configuration


When you have just created a new Plone site, you will see a warning here telling you to set up outgoing email for your site.

We'll come to that later.
The configuration area is divided into several parts, leading to further setup screens.

.. note::

   Many add-ons also come with their own setup area, you will also find these here after you have installed and activated them.

General

Content
=======

Content Rules
    Set up :doc:`automated mechanisms <content-rules>` to act on content when certain events occur. You can get an email when somebody adds a new item in a specific folder, and much more.
Editing
    Control :doc:`various editing settings <editing>`: which graphical editor to use, should automatic locking be performed when someone is editing, etc.
Image Handling
    Set up the :doc:`image sizes that Plone generates <image-handling>` and control image quality.
Markup
    Control if you want to :doc:`allow Markdown, Restructured Text <markup>` and other text formats.
Content Settings
    This is :doc:`where to control workflow, visibility and versioning of content<content-settings>`.
Dexterity Content types

Users
=====

Users and Groups
    :doc:`Create, define, delete and otherwise control <users-groups>` the users that can log in. Define groups and assign users to them, and define which properties (like email, address, or job position in your organisation) you would like to store.

Security
========

HTML Filtering
    Set :doc:`which kind of tags <html-filtering>` you will allow users to enter. Malicious users, or users whose computer is infected by malware, can enter unwanted or dangerous content. Here you can finely choose what is acceptible and what now.
Security
    Various :doc:`security and privacy related settings <security>`: Can users self-register? Should anonymous site visitors see author info on an article?
Error log
    This will :doc:`list errors and exceptions <errors>` that may have occurred recently. You can inspect them and store them, if wanted. These can point to potential problems with missing content, but also clues on security related matters.

Advanced
========

.. note::

   The following can have large impact for your site. Take care when applying new settings.

Maintenance
    :doc:`Maintenance for the back-end database <maintenance>`. You can check the size of the database, and regularly *pack* it to keep it in optimal condition.
Management Interface
    This will take you to the :doc:`Management Interface <management-interface>`.
    In normal use, there is no need to go here. **Experts only**.
    But should you require access to the underlying software stack, here it is.
Caching
    Here you can :doc:`enable and fine-tune <caching>` Plone's caching settings. This can have a great beneficial effect on the speed of your site, but make sure to read the documentation first.
Configuration Registry
    Provides :doc:`direct acces to all system variables <configuration-registry>`. Handle with care.
Resource Registries
    Provides :doc:`direct access to JavaScript, CSS and LESS resources <resource-registries>`.
