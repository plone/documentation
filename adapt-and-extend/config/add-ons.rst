Here you can activate and deactivate add-ons.

.. note::

   Before an add-on will show up here, you will first have to *install* it.

   See the :doc:`section on installing add-ons </adapt-and-extend/install_add_ons>`

If you have *upgraded* add-ons, there are often *upgrade steps* to bring all configuration of your add-on to the new standard.

This is also where you will be doing that.
