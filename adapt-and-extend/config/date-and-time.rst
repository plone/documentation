You can set the default timezone, which is usually the one your server is in.

If you make more timezones available, users can set their own timezone.
That way, dates and times will be converted to their time zone.

.. note::

   This can be convenient, but potentially confusing.

   Imagine you are announcing a spectacular Event on your site: a gala fundraiser at the Ritz Theatre, Thursday, 21.00 hours.
   Logged-in visitors who are yet to travel from their timezone to your grand event will see the starting time in their own timezone.
