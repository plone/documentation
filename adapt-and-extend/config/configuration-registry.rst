======================
Configuration Registry
======================

Users with role "Manager" can directly see, and change, many variables that influence Plone.

As you can see, there is a large number of these, and finding the right one is quicker done by filtering or selecting a prefix.
(Add-on packages will also create their own prefix)

.. note::

   Setting variables directly here is *not* recommended as part of regular maintenance.
   It is a useful tool for *inspecting* variables for expert users.
