Of the various settings here, the most important ones are:

Enable self-registration
    Setting this option will mean that new users can register themselves.
    It is **strongly** advised to keep the "let users select their own passwords" **UN**checked when choosing this option, as at least all new users will have to have a valid email.
    This helps in slowing down bot-generated attacks.
Use email address as login name
    As most people have difficulty remembering login names, it can be good to allow email addresses as logins.
