**The Plone community** is an incredibly diverse group that bridges many types and sizes of organizations, many countries and languages, and everything from technical novices to hardcore programmers.
Out of that diversity comes an attention to detail in code, function, user interface and ease of use that makes Plone one of the top 2% of open source projects worldwide. (Source: `Ohloh <http://www.ohloh.net/>`_)

**Need a CMS that integrates** with Active Directory, Salesforce, LDAP, SQL, Web Services. LDAP or Oracle? Plone does.
Need to be sure your website is accessible? Plone meets or exceeds US Government 508 and W3C's WAI-AA standards.

**Worried about security?** As an open source product, a large number of developers frequently scrutinize the code for any potential security issues.
This proactive approach is better than the wait-and-see approach in proprietary software that relies on keeping security issues a secret instead of resolving them outright.
Based on Python and the Zope libraries, Plone has a technological edge that has has helped it attain the best security track record of any major CMS (Source: `CVE <http://cve.mitre.org/>`_).
In fact, security is a major reason why many CMS users are switching to Plone.


The market is full of open source content management systems, so it is important to do your homework before choosing one for your organization.
Remember that a simple CMS may work out great to start with, but lead to problems with scaling or migration when you need more capability than it can provide.
At the other end of the spectrum, a powerful CMS can be so difficult to learn and maintain that it never gains acceptance to users.
Make sure the CMS you choose meets your needs today without compromising future growth.
We hope you'll take the time to learn more about Plone and what it can do for you.
We've created this site specifically as a gateway to information on how to get started with Plone, as well as information on development, solutions providers, events, news, and the wealth of product add-ons created by the community.



What does Plone mean? How is it pronounced?
-------------------------------------------

*Does the word Plone mean anything, and where does it come from? Why is Plone called Plone?*

The word Plone originally comes from the electronic band Plone that used to exist on the Warp record label. The music is playful and minimalistic.

The founders of Plone-the-Software (Alan Runyan and Alexander Limi) were listening to Plone-the-Band when they met (as well as during the initial coding/design of Plone) - and one of the original quotes floating around at the time was that "Plone should look and feel like the band sounds". Thus, a legend was born. ;)

Plone-the-Band `broke up in 2001 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone_%28band%29>`_, but Plone-the-Software lives on.

Plone is pronounced in the same manner as the word "grown". It is not spelled out when you say it, and is not an abbreviation for anything.
