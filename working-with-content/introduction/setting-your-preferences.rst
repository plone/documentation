Setting Your Preferences
=============================

After logging in to a Plone web site, you can change your personal
preferences for information about your identity and choice of web site
settings.

After logging in, your full name will be posted on the top-right corner
of the screen. Click your name to open the dropdown, then click on the
*Dashboard* link to go to your personal area:

You will see the dashboard** panel:

When you log in for the first time, your dashboard will be empty, as the
Info message explains. Portlets are specific "views" of different types
of content. You can choose which ones you want in your dashboard by
clicking the *Edit* tab, but we'll get to that in a second.

First, let's look at the *Preferences* link in the previous dropdown,
which will bring up the personal preferences edit panel:

Date entry fields include:

-  *Full Name*- If your name is common, include your middle initial or
   middle name.
-  *E-mail address* - REQUIRED - You may receive emails from the web
   site system, or from a message board, if installed, etc. When an item
   is required, a little red square will show alongside the item.
-  *Location*text box** - This is the name of your city, town, state,
   province, or whatever you wish to provide*.
   *
-  *Language preference* selection menu - Plone excels at offering
   multilingual support.
-  *Biography* text box - Enter a short description of yourself here,
   about a paragraph or so in length.
-  *Home page* web address - If you have your own web site or an area at
   a photo-sharing web site, for instance, enter the web address here,
   if you wish, so people can find out more about you.
-  *Content editor* selection menu - You have the choice of using
   TinyMCE or Kupu, which lets you edit web pages with a nice graphical
   interface, or using a basic editing panel, which is good if you are
   accustomed to writing web pages using HTML (the basic "code" of web
   pages). The default setting for new sites is to use TinyMCE, and is
   assumed in this user manual.
-  *Enable external editing* checkbox - This is for switching on and off
   an "external" editor, if one has been installed by the web site
   administrator. Use of an "external" editor is mainly for web
   designers and programmers who do more editing of actual code, but it
   could be useful for volume page creation using specialized text
   mark-up languages. (Don't worry about this setting if you haven't
   heard anything about it from your web site administrator).
-  *Portrait* photograph upload - The portrait photograph will appear as
   a small image or thumbnail-size image, so it is best to use a head
   shot or upper-torso shot for this.

You can change your preferences whenever you wish.
