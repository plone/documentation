Inserting Images
=====================

A description of the options available for inserting images with
TinyMCE.

The TinyMCE editor allows you to insert image files stored in Plone into
your document, using the |Image| button on the TinyMCE toolbar:

.. figure:: /_static/toolbar_image.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

Clicking this button launches the Insert Image dialog:

.. figure:: /_static/insert_image_dialog.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

The three columns of the dialog display:

-  In the first column - a folder navigation list.
-  In the second column - an object navigation list, from which you can
   select your image file.
-  In the third column - image preview, and options for alignment, size
   and captions.

In the example above, an image of a rose was selected - rose.png (rather
large one, at its original size of 600\*450 pixels).

According to the "Image alignment" option you choose, the image will be
placed in your page (and the following HTML code will be generated):

-  lefthand (<img class="image-left captioned" src="rose.png" alt="rose"
   />);
-  righthand (<img class="image-right captioned" src="rose.png"
   alt="rose" />);
-  inline (<img class="image-inline captioned" src="rose.png" alt="rose"
   />).

You may also choose the size of the image you need. This is especially
convenient when you deal with large images, as there is no need to use
Photoshop or other external image editing application to crop or change
the size of an image. The "Image size" dropdown list provides a choice
between many sizes and formats:

.. figure:: /_static/image_size.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

-  Large (<img src="rose.png/image\_large" alt="rose" />);
-  Preview (<img src="rose.png/image\_preview" alt="rose" />);
-  Mini (<img src="rose.png/image\_mini" alt="rose" />) - the
   minimum-size image is formed;
-  Thumb (<img src="rose.png/image\_thumb" alt="rose" />) - a
   thumb(inch)-size icon is made out of your image (little bigger than
   2,5cm);
-  Tile (<img src="rose.png/image\_tile" alt="rose" />) - a tile is made
   out of your image;
-  Icon (<img src="rose.png/image\_icon" alt="rose" />) - an icon is
   made out of your image;
-  Listing (<img src="rose.png/image\_listing" alt="rose" />) - a
   listing icon is made out of your image;

Image Captioning
----------------

It is possible to put image caption under the image in TinyMCE. Caption
is taken from image description. Alt text is taken from image title. Alt
text and caption update if image is updated.

To enable image captioning go to **Site Setup â†’ TinyMCE**. Make sure
that you have **Allow captioned images** selected in the **Resource
Types tab**.

When you add image to the site, you can put some text into its
description that will be displayed as an image caption.

.. figure:: /_static/add_image.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

Now when we create a page, and insert image into it, check the box
Caption:

.. figure:: /_static/insert_image_caption.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

Save this page, and you will see the image followed by its description
as the caption all inserted into a frame:

.. figure:: /_static/caption_page.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt:

.. |Image| image:: /_static/image.png
