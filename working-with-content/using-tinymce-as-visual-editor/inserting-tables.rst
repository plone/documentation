Inserting Tables
=====================

Inserting, updating and deleting tables, columns, rows and cells.

Tables are handy for tabular data and lists. To add a table, put your
cursor where you want it and click the *Inserts a new table* icon.
You'll see the *Insert/Modify table* panel:

Setting rows and columns is straightforward. You can add a summary of
the table in the *Summary* field if you like. Table class refers to how
you want the table to be styled. You have choices such as these:

After the table has been created you can click in a cell to show table
resizing handles:

In the table above, the cursor has been placed in the "Special Leader"
cell, which activates little square handles around the edges for
resizing the entire table. It also activates the other table controls in
the toolbar which, lets you edit properties of a row or a cell, lets you
add and remove rows or columns and lets you split and merge cells.
