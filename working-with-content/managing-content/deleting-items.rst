Deleting Items
===================

Items may be deleted from a folder with ease.

Sometimes it is necessary to delete a content item, often to replace it
with an updated version. Or, you could simply delete an item, for a
variety of reasons. In the example of the swallowtail butterfly
mistakenly added to the Skippers folder, instead of cutting it and
pasting it somewhere, it could simply be deleted:

.. figure:: /_static/operationdelete.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

In the example shown above, the *Eastern Tiger Swallowtail* folder is
will be deleted after clicking on the *Delete* button.

Entire folders may be deleted, so care must be taken with the delete
operation, but this is true for computer use in general, and we all have
learned to do a last minute self-check to make sure the delete operation
is intended.
