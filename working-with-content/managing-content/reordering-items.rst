Reordering Items
=====================

The contents tab contains functionality for quick and precise reordering
of items in a folder.

Consider the following folder, called "Skippers," for holding
information about this type of butterfly.Â Often, when we add content
items, we don't initially get them in the order we want.Â The desired
ordering is not always alphabetical, but in this example we can assume
so. Below you see the Skipper butterfly subfolders are not in
alphabetical order:

.. figure:: ../_static/copy_of_foldercontents.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

To move the top item named "Spread-winged Skippers" to the bottom of the
list, one would click within the Order column on the left (containing
the "double-colon" symbols) and drag the row to the desired position:

   :align: center

Dragging and dropping is done by holding the mouse button down as you
move the item. The item that is being moved turns yellow as it is being
moved:

.. figure:: ../_static/foldercontentsdrag.png
   :align: center

When the mouse button is released, the item stays where it was dropped:

.. figure:: ../_static/foldercontentsdrop.png
   :align: center
