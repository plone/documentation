.. _rst_prev-next-links:

Previous - Next Links
==========================

Automatic previous-next links for content items in a folder can be
enabled under the Settings tab for a folder.

The *Settings* tab is found by clicking the *Edit* tab for the folder.
There is a toggle for enabling previous-next links for items contained
in the folder:

.. figure:: ../_static/previousnextenabling.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Once enabled, as content items are added to the folder, previous and
next links will automatically appear as needed:

.. figure:: ../_static/previousnextexample.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Three pages have been created within the Cloudywings folder, and "Page
Two" (which has no text, for this example) has been clicked. At the
bottom of "Page Two" are links for "Previous: Page One" and "Next: Page
Three."

This is a *really* useful feature!
