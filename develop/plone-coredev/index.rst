Process for Plone core's development
====================================

Introduction
------------
This documentation describes the process for developing Plone. It is primarily a technical resource for setting up your core developer buildout, fixing bugs, and writing plips.


.. warning::

   STOP!


   Legally, you can NOT contribute code unless you have signed the :doc:`contributor agreement <agreement>`. This means that we can NOT accept pull requests from you unless this is done, so please don't put the code reviewers at risk and do it anyways. Submitting the agreement is easy (and will soon be easier) and if you want quick access and are familiar with the community, go into :doc:`irc <culture>` and ask one of the repo admins to give you access with a scanned copy of the agreement. They will get you going as fast as possible!
