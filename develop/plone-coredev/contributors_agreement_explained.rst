Contributor’s Agreement for Plone Explained
===========================================

Prospective contributors to the Plone core code base are required to sign a
contributor’s agreement, which assigns copyright in the code to the Plone
Foundation, the non-profit organization which stewards the Plone code base.
This document explains the purposes of this, along with questions and answers
about what this means.

The Plone Contributor Agreement can be found at:

About the Plone Contributor Agreement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Foundation feels that it benefits the community for a single organization
to hold the rights to Plone. Prior to the Foundation, the intellectual
property of Plone was jointly held by individual developers and by Alan
Runyan and Alexander Limi. The community members who formed the Foundation
felt that having the Foundation hold these rights provides several benefits:

1.  **Minimizing confusion / maximizing business compatibility** --
    Organizations considering adopting Plone have a simple answer for "Who
    owns this?", rather than a more complicated answer that might scare away
    the legally-cautious.

2.  **Trademark protection** -- By having the Foundation hold the
    trademarks and rights to the Plone branding assets, it can effectively
    protect these from unfair use.

3.  **Guarantee of future Open Source versions** -- The Foundation's
    contributor agreement ensures that there will **always** be an OSI-
    approved version of Plone.


Questions & Answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What does the contributor's agreement cover?

  This agreement is for the Plone core codebase only. The Plone core codebase is
  that code which lives in the Plone core version repositories, currently located at
  `http://dev.plone.org/plone`_ and `https://github.com/plone`_. Contributions to
  the "Collective," currently located at `http://dev.plone.org/collective`_ and
  `https://github.com/collective`_ are not assigned to the Plone Foundation, and
  are made available under whatever license the project developers wish to use,
  although add-on products that import from GPLed Plone code are of course subject
  to the terms of the GPL, which requires derived works to be GPL licensed.

What rights will I continue to have for my contributions?

  Contributors are asked to transfer their intellectual property rights to the Foundation.
  In return, they will be given back irrevocable rights to use and distribute their
  contributions. They can even give their contributions to other Open Source projects (as
  long as those projects are compatible with the license Plone itself is issued under) or
  use them in non-Open Source commercial applications (if that is compatible with the license
  Plone is under).

Do I have to sign the contributor's agreement to make checkins to the Plone core codebase?
  Yes.

Do I have to sign the contributor's agreement to submit a patch to the Plone core codebase?

  We enthusiastically welcome patches, but we can't merge them until you sign and return a
  contributor's agreement. (Unless, in the judgement of the Plone Release Manager, the patch
  is so tiny as not to constitute a "creative work." See the
  `Policy for Contributor Agreements and Patches`_ for more detail on this policy.)

Can I grant the Plone foundation a non-exclusive license to my contributions rather than an exclusive license, so that I can contribute the same code to other projects under different terms or use the contribution for other commercial endeavors?

  Not under the current version of the contributors agreement.

Does the Foundation control use of the Plone trademark?

  Yes. In order to keep the trademark, the Foundation (or any trademark owner) must
  demonstrate that they have acted to protect it.

Will Plone always be available under an OSI-approved/Open Source license? Couldn't the Board change its mind about this?

  Plone will always be available under an OSI-approved license; this is written into
  the language of the contributor agreement each developer and the foundation sign.

Will Plone ever be available under a non-GPL license?

  The current Plone approach states that companies can negotiate a non-GPL license.
  Thus, the Foundation might pursue a dual-licensing (GPL and non-GPL) scheme - but,
  at this time, the Board has not yet created any policies on this.
  This is an important question for the community, of course, and the Foundation intends
  to have this conversation in a transparent way.

Why would anyone want a non-GPL Plone?

  Two possible reasons: Some companies are reluctant to do in-house modifications of
  framework-like systems (such as Plone) that are under the GPL, fearing that a clause
  in the GPL might force them to disclose their internal work - thus wanting to license
  it under (for example) a BSD-style license. Second, companies may wish to offer a
  commercial version of Plone, under a conventional shrink-wrap license, without the
  obligation to reveal source code or share changes.

How much would a non-GPL version of Plone cost?

  Would a small company be able to afford one? -- Neither the Foundation nor the Board have
  made any decisions about a non-GPL version, let alone about pricing. However, one of the
  Foundation's stated goals is to maintain a level playing field for Plone while trying to
  benefit all of the Plone commons. If a non-GPL version was available, and a large company
  bought it, added features to it, and sold it, wouldn't they be using our work without an
  obligation to give back? It's helpful to remember the core value open source provides: distributed
  development, maintenance, security checking, and support. Companies that build large features
  for Plone are **already** having to make decisions of whether to release their products
  under an open source license or not (since they could always release them as a Product, not
  as a modification to the Plone core). Despite this, though, many large and excellent
  contributions - such as Archetypes - have been made, and the Foundation hopes that companies will
  continue to do so. In any event, a company that purchases a non-GPL license (should such ever
  become available) is contributing financial resources to our community, which can be used to
  further develop, market, and protect the GPL version of Plone.
