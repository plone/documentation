.. admonition:: Description

    How to programmatically create, read, edit and delete site members.

.. contents:: :local:

Introduction
============

In Plone, there are two loosely-coupled subsystems relating to members:

*Authentication and permission* information
    (``acl_users`` under site root), managed by the :term:`PAS`.
    In a default installation, this corresponds to Zope user objects.
    PAS is *pluggable*, though, so it may also be authenticating against
    an LDAP server, Plone content objects, or other sources.

*Member profile* information
    accessible through the ``portal_membership`` tool.
    These represent Plone members. PAS authenticates,
    and the Plone member object provides metadata about the member.


Getting the logged-in member
============================

Anonymous and logged-in members are exposed via the
:doc:`IPortalState context helper </develop/plone/misc/context>`.

Example (browserview: use ``self.context`` since ``self`` is not
acquisition-wrapped)::

    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter

    portal_state = getMultiAdapter(
            (self.context, self.request), name="plone_portal_state")
    if portal_state.anonymous():
        # Return target URL for the site anonymous visitors
        return self.product.getHomepageLink()
    else:
        # Return edit URL for the site members
        return product.absolute_url()

or from a template:

.. code-block:: html

    <div tal:define="username context/portal_membership/getAuthenticatedMember/getUserName">
        ...
    </div>

Getting any member
==================

To get a member by username (you must have ``Manager`` role)::

    mt = getToolByName(self.context, 'portal_membership')
    member = mt.getMemberById(username)

To get all usernames::

    mt = getToolByName(self.context, 'portal_membership')
    memberIds = mt.listMemberIds()

Getting member information
==========================

Once you have access to the member object,
you can grab basic information about it.

Get the user's name::

    member.getName()

Reseting user password without emailing them
-----------------------------------------------

* https://plone.org/documentation/kb/reset-a-password-without-having-to-email-one-to-the-user

Exporting and importing member passwords
----------------------------------------

You can also get at the hash of the user's password
(only the hash is available, and only for standard Plone user objects)
(in this example we're in Plone add-on context, since ``self`` is
acquisition-wrapped)::

    uf = getToolByName(self, 'acl_users')
    passwordhash_map = uf.source_users._user_passwords
    userpasswordhash = passwordhash_map.get(member.id, '')

Note that this is a private data structure.
Depending on the Plone version and add-ons in use, it may not be available.

You can use this hash directly when importing your user data,
for example as follows (can be executed from a
:doc:`debug prompt </develop/plone/misc/commandline>`.)::

    # The file 'exported.txt' contains lines with: "memberid hash"
    lines = open('exported.txt').readlines()
    changes = []
    c = 0
    members = mt.listMembers()
    for l in lines:
        memberid, passwordhash_exported = l.split(' ')
        passwordhash_exported = passwordhash_exported.strip()
        member = mt.getMemberById(memberid)
        if not member:
            print 'missing', memberid
            continue
        passwordhash = passwordhash_map.get(memberid)
        if passwordhash != passwordhash_exported:
            print 'changed', memberid, passwordhash, passwordhash_exported
            c += 1
            changes.append((memberid, passwordhash_exported))

    uf.source_users._user_passwords.update(changes)

Also, take a look at a script for exporting Plone 3.0's memberdata and
passwords:

* http://blog.kagesenshi.org/2008/05/exporting-plone30-memberdata-and.html



Iterating all site users
============================

Example::

    buffer = ""

    # Returns list of site usernames
    mt = getToolByName(self, 'portal_membership')
    users = mt.listMemberIds()
    # alternative: get member objects
    # members = mt.listMembers()

    for user in users:
       print "Got username:" + user

.. note::

    Zope users, such as *admin*, are not included in this list.


Getting all *Members* for a given *Role*
========================================

In this example we use the ``portal_membership`` tool.
We assume that a role called ``Agent`` exists and that we already
have the context::

    from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName

    membership_tool = getToolByName(self, 'portal_membership')
    agents = [member for member in membership_tool.listMembers()
                if member.has_role('Agent')]


Groups
======

Groups are stored as ``PloneGroup`` objects. ``PloneGroup`` is a subclass of
``PloneUser``.  Groups are managed by the ``portal_groups`` tool.

* https://github.com/plone/Products.PlonePAS/blob/master/Products/PlonePAS/plugins/ufactory.py

* https://github.com/plone/Products.PlonePAS/blob/master/Products/PlonePAS/plugins/group.py

Creating a group
----------------

Example::

    groups_tool = getToolByName(context, 'portal_groups')

    group_id = "companies"
    if not group_id in groups_tool.getGroupIds():
        groups_tool.addGroup(group_id)

For more information, see:

* https://github.com/plone/Products.PlonePAS/blob/master/Products/PlonePAS/tests/test_groupstool.py

* https://github.com/plone/Products.PlonePAS/blob/master/Products/PlonePAS/plugins/group.py

Add local roles to a group
--------------------------

Example::

   from AccessControl.interfaces import IRoleManager
   if IRoleManager.providedBy(context):
       context.manage_addLocalRoles(groupid, ['Manager',])

.. Note:: This is an example of code in a *view*, where ``context`` is
   available.

Update properties for a group
-----------------------------

The ``editGroup`` method modifies the title and description in the
``source_groups`` plugin, and subsequently calls ``setGroupProperties(kw)``
which sets the properties on the ``mutable_properties`` plugin.

Example::

    portal_groups.editGroup(groupid, **properties)
    portal_groups.editGroup(groupid, roles = ['Manager',])
    portal_groups.editGroup(groupid, title = u'my group title')

Getting available groups
------------------------

Getting all groups on the site is possible through ``acl_users`` and the
``source_groups`` plugin, which provides the functionality to manipulate
Plone groups.

Example to get only ids::

    acl_users = getToolByName(self, 'acl_users')
    # Iterable returning id strings:
    groups = acl_users.source_groups.getGroupIds()

Example to get full group information::

    acl_users = getToolByName(self, 'acl_users')
    group_list = acl_users.source_groups.getGroups()

    for group in group_list:
        # group is PloneGroup object
        yield (group.getName(), group.title)

List users within all groups
----------------------------

Example to get the email addresses of all users on a site, by group::

    acl_users = getToolByName(context, 'acl_users')
    groups_tool = getToolByName(context, 'portal_groups')
    groups = acl_users.source_groups.getGroupIds()
    for group_id in groups:
        group = groups_tool.getGroupById(group_id)
        if group is None:
            continue
        members = group.getGroupMembers()
        member_emails = [m.getProperty('email') for m in members]
        ...


Adding a user to a group
------------------------

Example::

    # Add user to group "companies"
    portal_groups = getToolByName(self, 'portal_groups')
    portal_groups.addPrincipalToGroup(member.getUserName(), "companies")

Removing a user from a group
------------------------------

Example::

    portal_groups.removePrincipalFromGroup(member.getUserName(), "companies")

Getting groups for a certain user
---------------------------------

Below is an example of getting groups for the logged-in user (Plone 3 and
earlier)::

    mt = getToolByName(self.context, 'portal_membership')
    mt.getAuthenticatedMember().getGroups()

In Plone 4 you have to use::

    groups_tool = getToolByName(self, 'portal_groups')
    groups_tool.getGroupsByUserId('admin')


Checking whether a user exists
===============================

Example::

    mt = getToolByName(self, 'portal_membership')
    return mt.getMemberById(id) is None

.. XXX: Why reference revision 110418 specifically?


Creating users
===============

Use the ``portal_registration`` tool. Example (browserview)::

    def createCompany(request, site, username, title, email, passwd=None):
        """
        Utility function which performs the actual creation, role and permission magic.

        @param username: Unicode string

        @param title: Fullname of user, unicode string

        @return: Created company content item or None if the creation fails
        """

        # If we use custom member properties they must be initialized
        # before regtool is called
        prepareMemberProperties(site)

        # portal_registration manages new user creation
        regtool = getToolByName(site, 'portal_registration')

        # Default password to the username
        # ... don't do this on the production server!
        if passwd == None:
            passwd = username

        # We allow only lowercase
        username = username.lower()

        # Username must be ASCII string
        # or Plone will choke when the user tries to log in
        try:
            username = str(username)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            IStatusMessage(request).addStatusMessage(_(u"Username must contain only characters a-z"), "error")
            return None

        # This is the minimum required information
        # to create a working member
        properties = {
            'username': username,
            # Full name must always be utf-8 encoded
            'fullname': title.encode("utf-8"),
            'email': email
            }

        try:
            # addMember() returns MemberData object
            member = regtool.addMember(username, passwd, properties=properties)
        except ValueError, e:
            # Give user visual feedback what went wrong
            IStatusMessage(request).addStatusMessage(_(u"Could not create the user:") + unicode(e), "error")
            return None

.. XXX: The unicode check above doesn't match the error message.

Batch member creation
-----------------------

* An example script can be run with bin/plonectl, tested on Plone 4.3.3; see http://gist.github.com/l34marr/02a9ef12a1e51c474bee

* An example script tested on Plone 2.5.x; see http://plone.org/documentation/kb/batch-adding-users


Email login
===========

* Plone 3 does not allow a dot in the username.
    * This is available as an add-on; see http://plone.org/products/betahaus.emaillogin

* In Plone 4, it is a default feature.


Custom member creation form: complex example
=============================================

Below is an example of a Grok form which the administrator can use to create
new users. New users will receive special properties and a folder for which
they have ownership access.  The password is set to be the same as the
username.  The user is added to a group named "companies".

Example ``company.py``::

    """ Add companies.

        Create user account + associated "home folder" content type
        for a company user.
        User accounts have a special role.

        Note: As of this writing, in 2010-04, we need the
        plone.app.directives trunk version which
        contains an unreleased validation decorator.
