Queries, Search And Indexing
============================

In plone, database index and search facilities are provided by portal_catalog tool.
There are two distinct functions.

**Indexing**: All searchable data is copied to the catalog when the object is indexed, to make object searchable and listable.

**Querying**: Search keys are matched against the indexed catalog copies to return the indexed metadata of the object.
