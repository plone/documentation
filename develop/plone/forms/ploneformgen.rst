.. admonition :: Description

   PloneFormGen allows you to build and maintain convenience forms through Plone edit interface.

Introduction
------------

*PloneFormGen* is a Plone add-on that provides a generic Plone form generator using fields, widgets and validators from Archetypes.
Use it to build simple, one-of-a-kind, web forms that save or mail form input.

To build a web form, create a form folder, then add form fields as contents.
Individual fields can display and validate themselves for testing purposes.
The form folder creates a form from all the contained field content objects.

Final disposition of form input is handled via plug-in action products.
Action adapters included with this release include a mailer, a save-data adapter that saves input in tab-separated format for later download, and a custom-script adapter that makes it possible to script simple actions without recourse to the Management Interface.

To make it easy to get started, newly created form folders are pre-populated to act as a simple e-mail response form.
