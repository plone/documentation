WYSIWYG text editing and TinyMCE
====================================

.. admonition:: Description

        WYSIWYG text field editor programming in Plone.

.. contents :: :local:

Introduction
------------

Plone supports TinyMCE (default), Kupu and CKEditor.

TinyMCE and Plone integration
is distributed in `Products.TinyMCE package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.TinyMCE>`_.

Disabling HTML filtering and safe HTML transformation
---------------------------------------------------------

By default Plone does HTML filtering to prevent `cross-site scripting <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>`_
attacks. This will make Plone to strip away from HTML

* `<script>` tags

* Some other potentially unsafe tags and attributes

If you need to put `<scrip>` tag on your content text in TinyMCE you can disable this security feature.

.. warning::

        If you don't trust all of your site editors, then this will open your site for an attack.

In the Zope Management Interface, at the top of a Plone site, go to portal_transforms and open the safe_html transform. Disable it by putting a "1" in the disable_transform field and saving.

A site restart might be required depending on Plone version.

Content linking
---------------------

Plone offers many kind of support and enhancements in site internal content linking

* Delete protection: :doc:`warning if you try to delete content which is being referred </develop/plone/content/deleting>`.

* Migrating of links when the content is being moved

The recommended method for linking the content is *Linking by UID* since *Products.TinyMCE* version 1.3.

* When the text is saved in TinyMCE all relative links are converted to :doc:`UID links </develop/plone/content/uid>` in the saved HTML payload

* When the text is displayed again, the HTML is run through output filter and UID links are converted back to human readable links

This solves issues with earlier Plone versions where the link targets become invalid when a HTML textfield with relative
links where shown on the other page as the original context.

.. note ::

   You might need to turn on *Linking by UID* setting on in the site setup if you are migrating from older Plone sites.

Editor preferences
---------------------

Plone supports user text changeable editor. The active editor is stored in
the :doc:`user preferences </develop/plone/members/member_profile>`.

The user can fallback to hand-edited HTML by setting active editor to none.

The rich text widget can also support optional input formats besides
HTML: structured text and so on.

Text format selector
=====================

The format selector itself is rendered by ``wysiwyg_support.pt`` macros
which is Plone core

* https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/master/Products/CMFPlone/skins/plone_wysiwyg/wysiwyg_support.pt

Applying styles only edit view
--------------------------------

You can use TinyMCE body selector make your CSS class have different styles in view and edit modes (inside TinyMCE)

.. code-block:: css


        /* Break columns in two column layout
         *
         * https://developer.mozilla.org/en/css3_columns
         *
         */

        .column-breaker {
                column-break-before: always;
                display: block;
        }

        .mceContentBody .column-breaker {
                color: red;
                border: 1px dashed red;
                display: block;
        }

.. note ::

        Firefox does not actually support column breaks, so this was useful headaching experience.

Customizing TinyMCE options
----------------------------

In your add-on code, all TinyMCE options in the control panel can be exported and imported
:doc:`using GenericSetup, portal_setup and tinymce.xml </develop/addons/components/genericsetup>`.

* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.textfield


Hacking TinyMCE Javascript
---------------------------

Plone ships with pre-compressed TinyMCE source code enabled by default.

If you want to toy around with TinyMCE source code itself, you might
want to first enable the usage of debug version of TinyMCE source.

In ``Products.TinyMCE.skins`` open tiny_mce_src.js and
copy-paste its content into tiny_mce.js.

.. note ::

        Replacing tiny_mce.js with tiny_mce_src.js in portal_javascripts
        doesn't seem to work as it breaks TinyMCE plug-in loading.

TinyMCE plug-ins
------------------

TinyMCE consists of plug-ins. Existing plug-ins can be overlaid with your
custom version by loading Javascript after core TinyMCE load.

* Default TinyMCE plug-in Javascript files can be found under Products.TinyMCE/skins/tinymce/plugins

* Usually TinyMCE plug-ins dialogs load in <iframe> and HTML code loads separate CSS and JS
  files from the main site


Adding a new plug-in
------------------------------------

Here are instructions how to add new buttons to TinyMCE

Some rules

* Plug-in id goes to ``tinymce.xml``

* Your plug-in must be in a file called ``editor_plugin.js`` in skins layer

* You must have a skins layer folder named after your plug-in id

* You don't register plug-in Javascript *portal_javascripts*

* TinyMCE button row is in the main document. However, the edit area itself is in <iframe>.
  Also, many of TinyMCE dialogs are launched in <iframe> and they load a hardcoded
  set of Javascript files (they don't use any kind of Plone master template or <head> section).

So in the end you'll have a file::

    yourcompany.app./yourcompany/app/skins/tinymce_plugin_flowplayer/flowplayer/editor_plugin.js

Why all this? I don't know. And honestly, in this point, I don't care.

Register your specially named skin layer in ``skins.xml``::

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <object name="portal_skins" meta_type="Plone Skins Tool">


     <object name="tinymce_plugin_flowplayer"
        meta_type="Filesystem Directory View"
        directory="your.app:skins/tinymce_plugin_flowplayer"/>

     <skin-path name="*">
      <layer name="tinymce_plugin_flowplayer"
         insert-after="custom"/>
     </skin-path>

    </object>

Register your plugin in ``tinymce.xml`` GenericSetup install profile

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <object>

     <toolbar>
      <customtoolbarbuttons purge="False">
        <element value="flowplayer"/>
      </customtoolbarbuttons>
     </toolbar>

     <resourcetypes>

      <customplugins purge="False">
        <element value="flowplayer"/>
      </customplugins>

Then finally drop a ``editor_plugin.js`` to your plug-in folder

.. code-block:: javascript

    /**
     * a TinyMCE plug-in for opening a dialog asking a video link and creating Flowplayer code out of it
     *
     */

    (function() {

        tinymce.create('tinymce.plugins.FlowplayerPlugin', {

            init : function (ed, url) {

                var t = this;
                t.url = url;
                t.editor = ed;
                t.docs = false;

                ed.addButton('flowplayer', {
                    title : 'Video',
                    cmd : 'flowplayer',
                    image : url + '/img/flowplayer.gif'
                });

                ed.addCommand('flowplayer', function (val, page) {
                    var url = prompt("Copy-paste URL to MP4 video file", "");
                    // note: flowplayer link must not have text inside
                    html = '<a class="flow-player tinymce-flow-player" href="' + url + '" />';
                    ed.execCommand('mceInsertContent', false, html);
                });

                //ed.onPostRender.add(t._setupTOC, t);
            },

            getInfo : function () {
                return {
                    longname : 'collective.flowplayer video insert plug-in ',
                    author : 'Mikko Ohtamaa',
                    authorurl : 'http://webandmobile.mfabrik.com',
                    infourl : 'http://webandmobile.mfabrik.com',
                    version : "1.0"
                };
            }
       });

       tinymce.PluginManager.add('flowplayer', tinymce.plugins.FlowplayerPlugin);
    })();

Media resources
==================

TinyMCE exposes URL to your plug-in base folder, where editor_plugin.js is, as plug-in ``init()`` parameter.

You can construct relative URLs to set media resources in ``init()``.

.. code-block:: javascript

            ed.addButton('flowplayer', {
                title : 'Video',
                cmd : 'video',
                image : url + '/img/placegallery.gif'
            });

Language resources
=======================

TinyMCE does not directly accept strings as labels, but uses its own internal translation mechanism which is not gettext.

* Create folder ``langs`` under plug-in base folder

* There create file ``en.js``

Sample content

.. code-block:: javascript

    tinyMCE.addI18n('en.placegallery',{
        desc : 'Placegallery button'
    });

Customizing existing plug-in
------------------------------------

The recommended way is to customize TinyMCE

* Re-register plug-in by simply including a plug-in JS code
  in a separate Javascript file loaded after tinymce.js

* override existing individual TinyMCE files using
  :doc:`jbot </adapt-and-extend/theming/templates_css/skin_layers>`.

Overriding plug-in
===================================

Create a duplicate of plug-in JS file (table.js),
register it as a custom Javascript from your add-on resource folder.

TinyMCE overrides previous plug-in registrations with new ones
and you can just re-register your own plug-in version to override the existing version.

* Refer it in portal_javascripts

.. code-block:: xml

        <!-- TinyMCE customizations -->
        <javascript
                id="++resource++your.app/tiny_mce_special.js"
                authenticated="True"
                cacheable="True" compression="safe" cookable="True" insert-after="tinymce.js"
                enabled="True" expression=""
                inline="False"
                />



Overriding plug-in resources
===================================

Yoiu can also override CSS, HTML (.htm.pt templates) with ``z3c.jbot``
as instructed above.

Example::

        jbot/Products.TinyMCE.skins.tinymce.plugins.table.js.table.js

.. warning ::

        Since there resources are loaded in <iframe> the normal browser refresh
        does not trigger reload for them. Right click <iframe>, choose Refresh
        from context menu.

Ploneboard and anonymous editor
-------------------------------

Problems with TinyMCE and Ploneboard.

TinyMCE shortcuts
-------------------

``Products.TinyMCE`` versions 1.3+ provide a shortcut view in
link and image dialogs. You can add your own site specific shortcuts here.

The most common use case is a shortcut link a folder which acts
as a site image bank. On multilingual sites this folder is

* Below natural language folders in the site root

* Language neutral

These make navigating to the folder using normal means very difficult.

New TinyMCE shortcuts can be registered as global utility via
`Products.TinyMCE.interfaces.IShortcut interface <https://github.com/plone/Products.TinyMCE/blob/master/Products/TinyMCE/interfaces/shortcut.py>`_.

.. image :: tinymce_images.png

We'll register our image bank as a shortcut into TinyMCE image dialog.

First make sure your add-on is :doc:`grok'ed </develop/addons/components/grok>`.

Then drop in the following file ``shortcut.py`` file into your :doc:`add-on </develop/plone/getstarted/index>`::

    from five import grok

    from Products.TinyMCE.interfaces.shortcut import ITinyMCEShortcut

    class ImageBankShortcut(grok.GlobalUtility):
        """Provides shortcut to the language neutral image bank below language folders """

        grok.name("imagebank")
        grok.provides(ITinyMCEShortcut)

        # This time we don't bother with i18n and assume
        # the whole world understands Finnish
        title = u'Kuvapankki'

        # Portal root relative path
        link = "/kuvapankki"

        def render(self, context):

            # http://collective-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/misc/context.html
            portal_state = context.restrictedTraverse('@@plone_portal_state')

            return ["""
            <img src="img/folder_current.png" />
            <a id="currentfolder" href="%s">%s</a>
            """ % (portal_state.portal_url() + self.link, self.title)]

After this you still need to go to TinyMCE control panel
(``http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@tinymce-controlpanel``)
and enable the link button in the settings for *Image Shortcuts*.

.. note ::

  You might also want to disable TinyMCE inline image uploads through CSS
  and disable image creation in arbitrary folders on your site. Currently
  the only way is to override TinyMCE internal CSS files using z3c.bot.
