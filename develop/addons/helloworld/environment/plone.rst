Install Plone
===============

.. admonition:: Description

    A simple tutorial introducing the basics of Plone development.

.. contents:: :local:

Now that we have a virtual_env, we can move on the to third step of our process; installing Plone. First, we need to install ZopeSkel.

Install ZopeSkel
-----------------

ZopeSkel simplifies the process of setting up Plone development.

The Plone community is transitioning between ZopeSkel 2.21.2 and a major rewrite currently at 3.0b3. Currently, the Plone installers use version 2.21.2. (August 2012) For more information about ZopeSkel see the :doc:`Bootstrapping Plone add-on development </develop/addons/paste>` section of this manual.

We will install ZopeSkel 2.21.2 in our virtual_env and and use it to install Plone.

- Install ZopeSkel 2.21.2.::

    # change your working directory to the virtual_env
    cd env-27
    ./bin/easy_install -U ZopeSkel==2.21.2

This adds some files to the bin directory, including **zopeskel**.::

Install Plone using ZopeSkel
-----------------------------

ZopeSkel uses templates to build structure for Python, Zope and Plone projects. Here, we use the **plone4_buildout** template to create a Plone 4 buildout in the **hello_world** directory.

- Create the Plone 4 buildout with zopeskel.::

    ./bin/zopeskel plone4_buildout hello_world

ZopeSkel displays some information and then asks what version of Plone we want to install. We want 4.2.::

        Plone Version (Plone version # to install) ['4.1']: 4.2

The tutorial sometimes refers to the hello_world directory as the **buildout directory**. It contains the **buildout.cfg** file.::

    [michaelc@Cullerton env-27]$ ll
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x  16 michaelc  staff  544 Aug 25 21:02 bin
    drwxr-xr-x   7 michaelc  staff  238 Aug 25 21:25 hello_world
    drwxr-xr-x   3 michaelc  staff  102 Aug 25 20:39 include
    drwxr-xr-x   3 michaelc  staff  102 Aug 25 20:39 lib

    [michaelc@Cullerton env-27]$ ll hello_world/
    total 32
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  5773 Aug 25 21:25 README.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  3784 Aug 25 21:25 bootstrap.py
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  2789 Aug 25 21:25 buildout.cfg
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:25 src
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:25 var

- Bootstrap the system with the Python included in our virtual_env.::

    # change your working directory to hello_world
    cd hello_world
    ../bin/python bootstrap.py

The bootstrap process creates some directories and adds a buildout script to the bin directory.::

    [michaelc@Cullerton hello_world]$ ll
    total 32
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  5773 Aug 25 21:25 README.txt
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:31 bin
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  3784 Aug 25 21:25 bootstrap.py
    -rw-r--r--  1 michaelc  staff  2789 Aug 25 21:25 buildout.cfg
    drwxr-xr-x  2 michaelc  staff    68 Aug 25 21:31 develop-eggs
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:31 parts
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:25 src
    drwxr-xr-x  3 michaelc  staff   102 Aug 25 21:25 var

    [michaelc@Cullerton hello_world]$ ll bin
    total 8
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff  331 Aug 25 21:31 buildout

- Run buildout to install Plone. This can take a while.::

    ./bin/buildout

Buildout uses **recipes** that tell it what to install. These recipes can specify the versions of modules they need. Buildout picks a version when one is not specified. It keeps track of these **picked versions** and displays them when it is finished. You can add these to the [versions] section of buildout.cfg to pin them. This gives you a known good set you can work from, allowing you to rerun buildout in the future or on a different machine, and know you have the same environment.::

    *************** PICKED VERSIONS ****************
    [versions]
    Cheetah = 2.2.1
    ZopeSkel = 3.0b3
    i18ndude = 3.2.2
    templer.buildout = 1.0b1
    templer.core = 1.0b4
    templer.localcommands = 1.0b2
    templer.plone = 1.0b1
    templer.plone.localcommands = 1.0b1
    templer.zope = 1.0b2
    zopeskel.dexterity = 1.4

    *************** /PICKED VERSIONS ***************

Notice that the Plone buildout installed ZopeSkel 3.0b3 for us. It is installed in the bin directory. We now have access to both versions of ZopeSkel; 2.21.2 in our virtual_env, and 3.0b3 in our Plone installation.::

    [michaelc@Cullerton hello_world]$ ll bin/
    total 136
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff    331 Aug 25 21:31 buildout
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff    375 Aug 25 21:35 develop
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff   1495 Aug 25 21:36 i18ndude
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff  15806 Aug 25 21:36 instance
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff    999 Aug 25 21:36 paster
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff  15818 Aug 25 21:36 test
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff  16064 Aug 25 21:36 zopepy
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 michaelc  staff   1015 Aug 25 21:36 zopeskel

Also notice the script named **instance**. Use this script to start, stop and restart Plone.::

    ./bin/instance start
    ./bin/instance stop
    ./bin/instance restart

You can also start Plone in foreground mode. This prints log messages to your terminal which is nice during development.::

    ./bin/instance fg

You can always look at the event log directly. It should be located at *var/log/instance.log*. You can watch it using the tail command.::

    tail -f var/log/instance.log

You can access the Plone site in your browser at::

    http://localhost:8080/

The first time you access the site, you will need to click on the *Create a new Plone site* button to perform some initialization.

    .. image:: /develop/addons/helloworld/images/createplonesite.png

You'll be presented with a form titled **Create a Plone site**. Keep the defaults for now, and click on the *Create Plone Site* button at the bottom. After a few moments, you should see the Home page of your site.

Quick Review
-------------

Before moving on, lets review what our directory structure lools like. Inside the *python_dev* directory we have *buildout.python* and *env-27*.

Inside *env-27* we have the **hello_world** directory, our Plone installation. Called the **buildout_directory**, it has the **buildout.cfg** file, and a script in the bin directory named **instance** used to start and stop Plone.

.. image:: /develop/addons/helloworld/images/directory_structure_plone.png


.. Note::

    Now that we have our virtual_env, we won't use *buildout.python* again for these examples. However, you can return there later to create new virtual environments for other Python projects.::

         # from the **python_dev** directory
         ./buildout.python/bin/virtualenv-2.7 some_other_env-27

    You can also build the versions of Python that we skipped in the Build Python section above, and then use them to build new Python virtual_envs.::

         # from the **python_dev** directory
         ./buildout.python/bin/virtualenv-3.2 some_env-32
