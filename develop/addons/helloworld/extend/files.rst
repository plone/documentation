Files and Directories

.. admonition:: Description

    A simple tutorial introducing the basics of Plone development.

Before we start writing code, I want to review some important files and directories. In the examples above, we created the **hello_world** directory that contains our Plone installation. We sometimes refer to it as the **buildout** directory. It contains the **buildout.cfg** file.

We also created an add-on package named **example.helloworld**. It contains the **example** directory which contains the **helloworld** directory. We also call the *helloworld* directory the **product directory**. Among other things, the *product directory* contains the **browser** directory. Many of the changes in our examples happen in the *browser* directory.
