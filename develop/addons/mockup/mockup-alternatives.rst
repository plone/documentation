Mockup and Alternatives
=======================

Mockup was created at a time when no alternatives were in sight. But
nowadays, with the explosion of JavaScript Frameworks, there are plenty of
them.

Web Components
--------------

Web Components are a W3C draft and will likely gain a lot of momentum once
browsers better support it. Web components can already be used by using Google's
Polymer or Mozilla's X-Tags libraries. The only drawback is that those
libraries only work for recent browser generations.

When Web Components gather more momentum, they will make Mockup obsolete. It's
hard to say when this will happen. Maybe in one or two years? However, Mockup
can probably be changed to use Web Components, so there will be an upgrade
path.


Angular JS Directives
---------------------

Angular JS also provides a framework to build reusable components. Actually,
everything DOM related is implemented as a directive (TODO: PROOF). The Angular
JS way of defining directives feels a lot like defining patterns in Mockup. Of
course, Angular JS grew so much that Mockup has a hard time to compete with it.
However, Angular JS provides a lot more than Mockup and for projects who do
not want to use this fully fledged, all inclusive Framework but need something
to manage JavaScript snippets of widgets, Mockup is a good choice.
