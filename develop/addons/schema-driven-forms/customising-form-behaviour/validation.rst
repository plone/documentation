Validation
============

**How to validate a form prior to processing**

All forms apply some form of validation.
In *z3c.form,* validators can be executed in action handlers.
If the validation fails, the action handler can choose how to proceed.
For “submit” type buttons, that typically means showing error messages next to the relevant form fields.
For “cancel” type buttons, the validation is normally skipped entirely.

Form validation takes two forms:

- Field-level validation, pertaining to the value of an individual field, and form-level validation, pertaining to the form as a whole.
- Form-level validation is less common, but can be useful if fields have complex inter-dependencies.

Field-level validation
----------------------

The simplest field-level validation is managed by the fields themselves.

All fields support a *required* attribute, defaulting to *True*.
The default field validator will return an error if a required field is not filled in.

Some fields also support more specific properties that affect validation:

-  Text fields like *Bytes*, *BytesLine*, *ASCII*, *ASCIILine*, *Text* and *TextLine*,
   as well as sequence fields like *Tuple*, *List*, *Set*, *Frozenset* and *Dict* all support two properties, *min\_length* and *max\_length*,
   which can be set to control the minimum and maximum allowable length of the field’s value.
-  Numeric fields like *Int, Float* and *Decimal*, as well as temporal fields like *Date*, *Datetime* and *Timedelta* all support two properties, *min* and *max*, setting minimum and maximum (inclusive) allowable values.
   In this case, the min/max value needs to be of the same type as field, so for an *Int* field, the value of this property is an integer,
   whereas for a *Datetime* field, it is a Python *datetime* object.
-  A *Choice* field only allows values in a particular vocabulary.
   We will cover vocabularies in the next section.

Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you require more specific validation, and you have control over the schema, you can specify a *constraint* function.
This will be passed the submitted value
(which is converted to a value appropriate for the field, so that e.g. a *List* field is passed a list).
If the value is acceptable, the function should return *True*.
If not, it should raise a *zope.schema.Invalid* exception or a derivative
(returning *False* will also result in an error, but one without a meaningful error message).

Here is the order form schema again, this time with a constraint function:

.. code-block:: python


    from example.dexterityforms.interfaces import MessageFactory as _
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import ISiteRoot
    from Products.statusmessages.interfaces import IStatusMessage
    from z3c.form import button
    from zope import schema
    from zope.interface import Invalid

    def postcode_constraint(value):
        """Check that the postcode starts with a 6
        """
        if not value.startswith('6'):
            raise Invalid(_(u'We can only deliver to postcodes starting with 6'))
        return True

    class IPizzaOrder(model.Schema):

        name = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Your full name'),
            )

        address1 = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Address line 1'),
            )

        address2 = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Address line 2'),
                required=False,
            )

        postcode = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Postcode'),
                constraint=postcode_constraint,
            )

        telephone = schema.ASCIILine(
                title=_(u'Telephone number'),
                description=_(u'We prefer a mobile number'),
            )

        orderItems = schema.Set(
                title=_(u'Your order'),
                value_type=schema.Choice(
                    values=[_(u'Margherita'), _(u'Pepperoni'), _(u'Hawaiian')]
                )
            )


Notice how the *postcode_constraint()*function is passed a value
(a unicode string in this case, since the field is a *TextLine*),
which we validate.
If we consider the value to be invalid, we raise an *Invalid* exception, with the error message passed as the exception argument.
Otherwise, we return *True*.

Field widget validators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constraints are relatively easy to write, but they have two potential drawbacks:
First of all, they require that we change the underlyinginterface.
This is no problem if the interface exists only for the form, but could be a problem if it is used in other contexts as well.
Second, if we want to re-use a validator for multiple forms, we would need to modify multiple schemata.

z3c.form’s field widget validators address these shortcomings.
These are specific to the form;
by contrast, constraints are a feature of *zope.interface* interfaces and apply in other scenarios where interfaces are used as well.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from example.dexterityforms.interfaces import MessageFactory as _
    from plone.directives import form
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from z3c.form import validator
    from zope import schema
    import zope.component
    import zope.interface

    # ...


    class IPizzaOrder(model.Schema):

        phone_number = schema.TextLine(
            title=_(u'Phone number'),
            description=_(
                u'Your phone number in international format. '
                u'E.g. +44 12 123 1234'
            ),
            required=False,
            default=u'')


    @form.validator(field=IPizzaOrder['phone_number'])
    def validate_phone_number(value):
        """Validate international phone number on input
        """

        allowed_characters = '+- () / 0123456789'

        if value != None:
            value = value.strip()

            if value == '':
                # Assume empty string = no input
                return

            # The value is not required
            for c in value:
                if c not in allowed_characters:
                    raise zope.interface.Invalid(
                        _(u'Phone number contains bad characters')
                    )

            if len(value) < 7:
                raise zope.interface.Invalid(_(u'Phone number is too short'))


The ``@form.validator.validator()`` decorator registers a validator adapter.
When the validation is invoked, the decorated function will be called with the field’s value as an argument and given an opportunity to raise a validation error, much like the constraint above.
Again like the constraint, the default validator is called first, so things like the required flag, and indeed any custom constraint, are processed first.

The ``@form.validator.validator()`` decorator can take keyword arguments to make the validator more specific or more generic.
The valid values are:

context
    The form’s context, typically an interface.
    This allows a validator to be invoked only on a particular type of content object.

request
    The form’s request.
    Normally, this is used to specify a browser layer.

view
    The form view itself.
    This allows a validator to be invoked for a particular type of form.
    As with the other options, we can pass either a class or an interface.

field
    A field instance, as illustrated above, or a field ``type``, for example, an interface like ``zope.schema.IInt``.

widget
    The widget being used for the field.

It is important to realise that if we don’t specify the *field* discriminator, or if we pass a field type instead of an instance, the validator will be used for all fields in the form (of the given type).
Also note how we had to define the constraint function before the form schema interface (since it was referenced in the schema itself), but we define this validator after the schema and form, since here we need the interface to have been defined before we use it.

Advanced field widget validators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``z3c.form`` validators are in fact a little more powerful than what we have seen above.
A validator is registered as a multi-adapter providing ``z3c.form.interfaces.IValidator`` and adapting the objects (``context``, ``request``, ``view``, ``field``, ``widget``), corresponding to the discriminants seen above.
You may wish to register an adapter directly instead of using the ``@form.validator.validator()`` decorator if you:

-  want to skip the default validation of field properties like ``required`` or ``min``/``max``,
-  need to access the ``context``, ``request``, ``form``, ``field`` and/or ``widget``, or instances to validate the value.

.. code-block:: python

    from example.dexterityforms.interfaces import MessageFactory as _
    from plone.directives import form
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from z3c.form import validator
    from zope import schema
    import zope.component
    import zope.interface

    # ...


    class IPizzaOrder(model.Schema):

        phone_number = schema.TextLine(
            title=_(u'Phone number'),
            description=_(
                u'Your phone number in international format. '
                u'E.g. +44 12 123 1234'
            ),
            required=False,
            default=u'')


    class PhoneNumberValidator(validator.SimpleFieldValidator):
        """z3c.form validator class for international phone numbers
        """

        def validate(self, value):
            """Validate international phone number on input
            """
            super(PhoneNumberValidator, self).validate(value)

            allowed_characters = '+- () / 0123456789'

            if value != None:
                value = value.strip()

                if value == '':
                    # Assume empty string = no input
                    return

                # The value is not required
                for c in value:
                    if c not in allowed_characters:
                        raise zope.interface.Invalid(
                            _(u'Phone number contains bad characters')
                        )

                if len(value) < 7:
                    raise zope.interface.Invalid(_(u'Phone number is too short'))


    # Set conditions for which fields the validator class applies
    validator.WidgetValidatorDiscriminators(
        PhoneNumberValidator,
        field=IPizzaOrder['phone_number']
    )

    # Register the validator so it will be looked up by z3c.form machinery
    # this should be done via ZCML
    zope.component.provideAdapter(PhoneNumberValidator)


This registers an adapter, extending the SimpleFieldValidator base class, and calling the superclass version of ``validate()`` to gain the default validation logic.
In the validate() method, we can use variables like self.context, self.request, self.view, self.field and self.widget to access the adapted objects.
The WidgetValidatorDiscriminators class takes care of preparing the adapter discriminators.

The valid values for WidgetValidatorDiscriminators are:

context
    The form’s context, typically an interface.
    This allows a validator to be invoked only on a particular type of content object.

request
    The form’s request.
    Normally, this is used to specify a browser layer.

view
    The form view itself.
    This allows a validator to be invoked for a particular type of form.
    As with the other options, we can pass either a class or an interface.

field
    A field instance, as illustrated above, or a field *type*, e.g. an interface like *zope.schema.IInt*.

widget
    The widget being used for the field

It is important to realise that if we don’t specify the *field* discriminator, or if we pass a field type instead of an instance, the validator will be used for all fields in the form (of the given type).


Form-level validation
---------------------

Form level validation is less common than field-level validation, but is useful if your fields are inter-dependent in any ways.
As with field-level validation, there are two options:

-  Invariants are specified at the interface level.
   As such, they are analogous to constraints.
-  Widget manager validators are standalone adapters that are specific to *z3c.form*.
   As such, they are analogous to field widget validators.

Invariants
~~~~~~~~~~

Invariants work much like constraints.
They are called during the form validation cycle and may raise *Invalid* exceptions to indicate a validation problem.
Because they are not tied to fields specifically, an error resulting from an invariant check is displayed at the top of the form.

Invariants are written as functions inside the interface definition, decorated with the *zope.interface.invariant* decorator.
They are passed a data object that provides the schema interface.
In the case of a *z3c.form* form, this is actually a special object that provides the values submitted in the request being validated, rather than an actual persistent object.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from example.dexterityforms.interfaces import MessageFactory as _
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from zope import schema
    from zope.interface import Invalid
    from zope.interface import invariant

    # ...

    class IPizzaOrder(model.Schema):

        name = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Your full name'),
            )

        address1 = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Address line 1'),
            )

        address2 = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Address line 2'),
                required=False,
            )

        postcode = schema.TextLine(
                title=_(u'Postcode'),
                constraint=postcodeConstraint,
            )

        telephone = schema.ASCIILine(
                title=_(u'Telephone number'),
                description=_(u'We prefer a mobile number'),
            )

        orderItems = schema.Set(
                title=_(u'Your order'),
                value_type=schema.Choice(values=[_(u'Margherita'), _(u'Pepperoni'), _(u'Hawaiian')])
            )

        @invariant
        def address_invariant(data):
            if data.address1 == data.address2:
                raise Invalid(_(u'Address line 1 and 2 should not be the same!'))

Here we have defined a single invariant, although there is no limit to the number of invariants that you can use.


Widget manager validators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Invariants have most of the same benefits and draw-backs as constraints:
they are easy to write, but require modifications to the schema interface, and cannot be generalised beyond the interface.

Not surprisingly therefore, *z3c.form* provides another option, in the form of a widget manager validator.
This is a multi-adapter for *(context, request, view, schema, widget manager*) providing *z3c.form.interfaces.IManagerValidator*.
The default simply checks invariants, although you can register your own override.

Overriding the widget manager validator is not particularly common,
because if you need full-form validation and you don’t want to use invariants,
it is normally easier to place validation in the action handler, as we will see next.

Invoking validators
-------------------

Unlike some of the earlier form libraries, *z3c.form* does not automatically invoke validators on every form submit.
This is actually a good thing, because it makes it much easier to decide when validation makes sense (e.g. there is no need to validate a “cancel” button).

We have already seen the most common pattern for invoking validation in our handler for the “order” button:

.. code-block:: python

        @button.buttonAndHandler(_(u'Order'))
        def handleApply(self, action):
            data, errors = self.extractData()
            if errors:
                self.status = self.formErrorsMessage
                return

            # Handle order here. For now, just print it to the console. A more
            # realistic action would be to send the order to another system, send
            # an email, or similar

            # ...

Notice, how we call *extractData()*, it returns both:

- a dictionary of the submitted data (for valid fields, converted to the underlying field value type) and
- a dictionary of errors (which is empty if all fields are valid).

Validating in action handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, it may be useful to perform additional validation in the action handler itself.
We can inspect the *data* dictionary, as well as any other aspect of the environment (like *self.context*, the context content object, or *self.request*, the request), to perform validation.

To signal an error, we use one of two exception types:

-  *z3c.form.interfaces.ActionExecutionError*, for generic, form-wide errors
-  *z3c.form.interfaces.WidgetActionExecutionError*, for field/widget-specific errors

In both cases, these exceptions wrap an *Invalid* exception.
Let’s add two examples to our action handler.

.. code-block:: python

    from example.dexterityforms.interfaces import MessageFactory as _
    from plone.supermodel import model
    from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import ISiteRoot
    from Products.statusmessages.interfaces import IStatusMessage
    from z3c.form.interfaces import ActionExecutionError
    from z3c.form.interfaces import WidgetActionExecutionError
    from zope import schema
    from zope.interface import Invalid
    from zope.interface import invariant

    import plone.autoform
    import z3c.form

    # ...


    class OrderForm(plone.autoform.form.AutoExtensibleForm, z3c.form.form.Form):

        # ...

        @z3c.form.button.buttonAndHandler(_(u'Order'))
        def handleApply(self, action):
            data, errors = self.extractData()

            # Some additional validation
            if 'address1' in data and 'address2' in data:

                if len(data['address1']) < 2 and len(data['address2']) < 2:
                    raise ActionExecutionError(
                        Invalid(_(u"Please provide a valid address"))
                    )
                elif len(data['address1']) < 2 and len(data['address2']) > 10:
                    raise WidgetActionExecutionError(
                        'address2',
                        Invalid(
                            u"Please put the main part of the address in the first field")
                        )

            if errors:
                self.status = self.formErrorsMessage
                return

Notice how we perform the check after the *extractData()* call, but before the possible premature return in case of validation errors.
This is to ensure all relevant errors are displayed to the user.
Also, note that whilst the invariant is passed an object providing the schema interface, the *data* dictionary is just that - a dictionary.
Hence, we use “dot notation” (*data.address1*) to access the value of a field in the invariant,
but “index notation” (*data[‘address1’]*) to access the value of a field in the handler.
