Copying A Plone Site
====================

.. admonition:: Description

   Quick instructions on how to create a copy of a Plone installation.


Introduction
============

These instructions tell you the basics of creating a duplicate of Plone site
for testing or back-up


Prerequisites
=============

* Ability to use file system manager to copy files from/to the remote server

* Ability to use the command line


Plone Site Contents
===================

In order to copy a Plone site the following must be copied

- ``buildout.cfg`` - defines your site package configuration
- ``src folder`` - all add-ons you have developed yourself
- ``var/filestorage/Data.fs`` - ZODB database of your site
- ``var/blobstorage`` folder which contains file-like objects of ZODB database (BLOBs)


Other folders (eggs, downloads, parts) etc. are generated by buildout command and may
be left empty.


Copying And Bootstrapping A Plone Site
=======================================

- Create a new site in the destination using Plone installer and make sure you can log-in to the site with temporary admin account
- Copy var/filestorage/Data.fs from the old system to the new system - note that admin password is stored in Data.fs and the password given during the creation of a new site is no longer effective after Data.fs copy
- Copy blobs from the old system to the new system by copying var/blobstorage/ folder
- Copy src/ folder from the old system if you have any custom development code there
- Copy buildout.cfg and other .cfg files
- Rerun buildout in order to automatically re-download and configure all Python packages needed to run the site
    - python bootstrap.py to make the buildout use new local Python interpreter
    - Then bin/buildout to regenerate parts/ folder

Copying Site Data In UNIX Environment
=====================================

Below are example UNIX commands to copy a Plone site data from a computer to
another over SCP/SSH connection.

The actual $USERNAME and folder locations depend on your system configuration.

.. note::

   A copy of the Plone site configuration must already exist on the target computer.

These instructions are for copying or creating a backup of your site data.

This operation can be performed on a running system - Data.fs is append only file and you
will lose transactions which happened during the copying of the end of the file.

Copy Local To Remote
====================

Run this command in your buildout Plone installation.

Copy Data.fs database:

.. code-block:: shell

   scp -C -o CompressionLevel=9 var/filestorage/Data.fs plone@server.com:/srv/plone/site/var/filestorage

Copy BLOB Files Using Rsync
===========================

BLOB files contain file and image data uploaded to your site.

Since the file content rarely changes after upload, rsync can synchronize only changed
files using -a (archive) flag.

.. code-block:: shell

   rsync -av --compress-level=9 var/blobstorage plone@server.com:/srv/plone/site/var
