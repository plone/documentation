Cache decorators

.. admonition:: Description

    How to use the Python decorator pattern to cache the result values of
    your computationally expensive method calls.

Introduction
============

Cache decorators are convenient methods caching of function return values.

Use them like this::

    @cache_this_function
    def my_slow_function():
        # This is run only once and all subsequent calls get value from the cache
        return

.. warning::

    Cache decorators do not work with methods or functions that use
    generators (``yield``).
    The cache will end up storing an empty value.

The `plone.memoize <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.memoize>`_ package
offers helpful function decorators to cache return values.

See also :doc:`using memcached backend for memoizers </manage/deploying/testing_tuning/performance/ramcache>`.

Cache result for process lifecycle
==================================

Example::

    from plone.memoize import forever

    @forever.memoize
    def getFields(area, subject):
        """ Get all fields inside area / subject.

        Results is cached for process lifetime.

        @return: List of internal fields
        """
        schema = getSchema(area)
        return [field for field in schema if field["subject"] == subject]


Timeout caches
==============

The @ram.cache decorator takes a function argument and calls it to get a value.
So long as that value is unchanged, the cached result of the decorated function is returned.
This makes it easy to set a timeout cache::

    from plone.memoize import ram
    from time import time

    @ram.cache(lambda *args: time() // (60 * 60))
    def cached_query(self):
        # very expensive operation,
        # will not be called more than once an hour

time.time() returns the time in seconds as a floating point number. "//" is Python's integer division.
So, the result of ``time() // (60 * 60)`` only changes once an hour.
``args`` passed are ignored.


Caching per request
===================

This pattern shows how to avoid recalculating the same value repeatedly
during the lifecycle of an HTTP request.

Caching on BrowserViews
------------------------

This is useful if the same view/utility is going to be called many times
from different places during the same HTTP request.

The `plone.memoize.view <https://github.com/plone/plone.memoize/blob/master/plone/memoize/view.txt>`_
package provides necessary decorators for ``BrowserView``-based classes.

.. code-block:: python

    from plone.memoize.view import memoize, memoize_contextless

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        @memoize
        def getValue():
            """ This value is recalculated for every new BrowserView context
                per request.
            """
            return "something"

        @memoize_contextless
        def getValueNoContext():
            """ This value is recalculated for all context objects once per
                request.
            """
            return "something"

Caching on Archetypes accessors
---------------------------------

If you have a custom
:doc:`Archetypes accessor method </develop/plone/content/archetypes/fields>`,
you can avoid recalculating it during the request processing.

Example::

    def getParsedORADataCached(self):
        """ Same as above, but does not run through JSON reader every time.
        """

        # Manually store the result on HTTP request object annotations

        # Use informative string + Archetypes unique identified as the key
        key = "parsed-ora-data-" + self.UID()

        cache = IAnnotations(self.REQUEST)
        data = cache.get(key, None)
        if data is not None:
            data = self.getParsedORAData()
            cache[key] = data

        return data

Caching using global HTTP request
----------------------------------

This example uses the
`five.globalrequest package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.globalrequest>`_
for caching. Values are stored on the thread-local ``HTTPRequest`` object
which lasts for the transaction lifecycle::

    from zope.globalrequest import getRequest
    from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAnnotations

        def _getProductList(self, type, language):
            """ Private implementation, builds list of products.
            """

            logger.info("Getting product list %s %s" % (type, language))
            ...
            return result


        def getProductListCached(self, type, language):
            """ Public cached method, delegates to _getProductList.
            """

            request = getRequest()

            key = "cache-%s-%s" % (type, language)

            cache = IAnnotations(request)
            data = cache.get(key, None)
            if not data:
                data = self._getProductList(type, language)
                cache[key] = data

            return data


Testing memoized methods inside browser views
=============================================

While testing browser views memoized methods you could find out that calling
a method multiple times inside a test could result in getting the same result
over and over, no mater what the parameters are, because you have the same
context and request inside the test and the result is being cached.

One approach to by-pass this is to put your code logic inside a private method
while memoizing a public method with the same name that only calls the private
one:

.. code-block:: python

    from plone.memoize import view
    from Products.Five import BrowserView

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        def _my_expensive_method():
            """Code logic goes here.
            """
            return "something"

        @view.memoize
        def my_expensive_method():
            """We just call the private method here and memoize the result.
            """
            return self._my_expensive_method()


In your tests you can call the private method to avoid memoization.
