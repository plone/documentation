.. note::

   Please note that this control panel page will never be themed.
   This is a safety measure, so that even when a Theme is not working correctly you can get back to this screen to disable or edit it.

.. note::

    The "Advanced settings" tab always configures the current active theme.
    If you change the theme, previously changed settings from another theme are lost.
