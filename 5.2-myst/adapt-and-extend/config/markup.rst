"Markup" languages like `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ and `RestructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ are popular with some users,
since they can be written using a keyboard without a mouse or pointing device.

Plone allows these markup languages to be used as text input alternatives, if you so desire.
