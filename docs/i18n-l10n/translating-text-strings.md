# Translating text strings

```{todo}
This entire chapter contains cruft dating back to Plone 3 in some parts.
It is perfectly fine to purge obsolete information.
```

```{note}
This chapter concerns only *code-level* translations of text strings.

For *user-generated content* translations, see {doc}`translating-content`.
```
