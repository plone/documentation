# `make build-backend` details

This chapter assumes you have previously followed {doc}`/install/create-project`.

The `Makefile` at the root of your project invokes commands in `backend/Makefile`.
Here are excerpts from `backend/Makefile` to show details of the `make build-backend` command.

```makefile
bin/pip:
	@echo "$(GREEN)==> Setup Virtual Env$(RESET)"
	python3 -m venv .
	bin/pip install -U "pip" "wheel" "cookiecutter" "mxdev"

instance/etc/zope.ini:	bin/pip
	@echo "$(GREEN)==> Install Plone and create instance$(RESET)"
	bin/cookiecutter -f --no-input --config-file instance.yaml https://github.com/plone/cookiecutter-zope-instance
	mkdir -p var/{filestorage,blobstorage,cache,log}

# ...

.PHONY: build-dev
build-dev: instance/etc/zope.ini ## pip install Plone packages
	@echo "$(GREEN)==> Setup Build$(RESET)"
	bin/mxdev -c mx.ini
	bin/pip install -r requirements-mxdev.txt
```

The command `make build-backend`:

-   Invokes the target `build-dev` target in `backend/Makefile`.
-   This invokes the target `instance/etc/zope.ini`.
-   This invokes the target `bin/pip`.

    -   This creates a `Python` virtual environment if one does not exist.
    -   It installs and upgrades Python package management tools in that virtual environment.

-   Returning to the target `instance/etc/zope.ini`:

    -   This creates or updates the Zope configuration from its `instance.yaml` file using `cookiecutter-zope-instance`.
    -   Creates specified directories, if they do not exist.

-   Returning to the target `build-dev`:

    -   This generates the `mxdev` files as described above in {ref}`manage-mxdev-usage-overview-label`.
    -   Installs Plone core packages and add-ons from the files generated by `mxdev`.

You can configure your Zope instance as described in the section {ref}`manage-common-management-tasks-label`.
