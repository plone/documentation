# Fields

This chapter describes the standard schema fields for Plone forms and content types.

The following tables show the most common field types for use in {doc}`/classic-ui/forms` and Dexterity {doc}`/backend/content-types/index`.
See {doc}`schemas </backend/schemas>` for information about how fields compose a schema for a form or content type data model.

```{tip}
In VS Code editor, you can install the [Plone Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Derico.plone-vs-snippets) extension.
This will give you snippets for most fields, widgets, and autoform directives in Python and XML based schemas.
```

## Field properties

You can initialize fields by passing properties into their constructors.
To avoid repeating the available properties for each field, we'll list them once here, grouped into the interfaces that describe them.
You'll see those interfaces again in the tables below that describe the various field types.
Refer to the table below to see what properties a particular interface implies.

| Interface | Property | Type | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `IField` | `title` | `int` | The title of the field. Used in the widget. |
| | `description` | `unicode` | A description for the field. Used in the widget. |
| | `required` | `bool` | Whether or not the field is required. Used for form validation. The default is `True`. |
| | `readonly` | `bool` | Whether or not the field is read only. Default is `False`. |
| | `default` | | The default value for the field. Used in forms and sometimes as a fallback value. Must be a valid value for the field if set. The default is `None`.|
| | `defaultFactory` | | The default factory method for the field. Used in forms and sometimes as a fallback value. This is a name of a method which returns a dynamic default value.|
| | `missing_value` | | A value that represents "this field is not set." Used by form validation. Defaults to `None`. For lists and tuples, it is sometimes useful to set this to an empty list or tuple. |
| `IMinMaxLen` | `min_length` | `int` | The minimum required length or minimum number of elements. Used for `string`, sequence, mapping, or `set` fields. Default is `0`. |
| | `max_length `| `int` | The maximum allowed length or maximum number of elements. Used for `string`, sequence, mapping, or `set` fields. Default is `None` (no check). |
| `IMinMax` | `min` | | The minimum allowed value. Must be a valid value for the field, for example, an `int` field should be an integer. Default is `None` (no check). |
| | `max` | | The maximum allowed value. Must be a valid value for the field, for example an `int` field should be an integer. Default is `None` (no check). |
| `ICollection` | `value_type` | | Another `Field` instance that describes the allowable values in a list, tuple, or other collection. Must be set for any collection field. One common usage is to set this to a `Choice` to model a multi-selection field with a {doc}`vocabulary </backend/vocabularies>`. |
| | `unique` | `bool` | Whether or not values in the collection must be unique. Usually not set directly. Use a `Set` or `Frozenset` to guarantee uniqueness in an efficient way. |
| `IDict` | `key_type` | | Another `Field` instance that describes the allowable keys in a dictionary. Similar to the `value_type` of a collection. Must be a `Set`. |
| | `value_type` | | Another `Field` instance that describes the allowable values in a dictionary. Similar to the `value_type` of a collection. Must be a `Set`. |
| `IObject` | `schema` | `Interface` | An interface that must be provided by any object stored in this field. |
| `IRichText` | `default_mime_type` | `str` | Default MIME type for the input text of a rich text field. Defaults to `text/html`. |
| | `output_mime_type` | `str` | Default output MIME type for the transformed value of a rich text field. Defaults to `text/x-html-safe`. There must be a transformation chain in the `portal_transforms` tool that can transform from the input value to the output value for the `output` property of the `RichValue` object to contain a value. |
| | `allowed_mime_types` | `tuple` | A list of allowed input MIME types. The default is `None`, in which case the site-wide settings from the {guilabel}`Markup` control panel will be used. |

See [`IField` interface](https://zopeschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#zope.schema.interfaces.IField) and [`field` implementation](https://zopeschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#field-implementations) in `zope.schema` documentation for details.

## Schema

With `plone.autoform` and `plone.supermodel` we can use directives to add information to the schema fields.


(backend-fields-schema-autoform-permission)=

### Protect a field with a permission

By default, fields are included in the form regardless of the user's permissions.
Fields can be protected using the `read_permission` and `write_permission` directives.
The read permission is checked when the field is in display mode, and the write permission is checked when the field is in input mode.
The permission should be given with its Zope 3-style name, such as `cmf.ManagePortal` instead of `Manage portal`.

In this example, the `secret` field is protected by the `cmf.ManagePortal` permission as both a read and write permission.
This means that in both display and input modes, the field will only be included in the form for users who have that permission:

```python
from plone.supermodel import model
from plone.autoform import directives as form

class IMySchema(model.Schema):
    form.read_permission(secret="cmf.ManagePortal")
    form.write_permission(secret="cmf.ManagePortal")
    secret = schema.TextLine(
        title = "Secret",
        )
```

In supermodel XML, the directives are `security:read-permission` and
`security:write-permission`:

```xml
<field type="zope.schema.TextLine"
        name="secret"
        security:read-permission="cmf.ManagePortal"
        security:write-permission="cmf.ManagePortal">
    <title>Secret</title>
</field>
```
