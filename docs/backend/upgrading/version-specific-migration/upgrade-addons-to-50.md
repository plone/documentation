# Upgrade a custom add-on to Plone 5.0

This chapter discusses how to upgrade a custom add-on to Plone 5.0.

## Archetypes

If your add-on depends on Archetypes, you will need some parts of `Products.ATContentTypes`.
Those parts will be declared by the profile "Archetypes-tools without content types".
It must be added to your `profiles/default/metadata.xml` that way:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>profile-Products.ATContentTypes:base</dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```


## JS/CSS bundle

Plone 5 does not use `portal_css` and `portal_javascript` anymore.
The add-on resources will have to be provided into a bundle.

Add a file named `registry.xml` in your profile, containing:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<registry>

  <records prefix="plone.bundles/ouraddon"
            interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IBundleRegistry'>
    <value key="enabled">True</value>
    <value key="jscompilation">++resource++mycustom.js</value>
    <value key="csscompilation">++resource++mycustom.css</value>

    <value key="last_compilation">2019-11-26 00:00:00</value>
    <value key="compile">False</value>
    <value key="depends">plone</value>
  </records>

</registry>
```

````{note}
This example assumes our JavaScript and CSS are provided as browser resources, but if they are in our old `skins` folder, that would work too:

```xml
<value key="csscompilation">portal_skins/MyAddon/mycustom.css</value>
```
````


## CSRF protection

Plone 5 provides a CSRF protection mechanism.
This mechanism is integrated into the different Plone frameworks.
If your add-on only uses default Dexterity or Archetypes features, you are safe.

But any custom redirection or form submission will have to include a token provided by `plone.protect`.

-   In a template:
  
    ```xml
    <span tal:replace="structure context/@@authenticator/authenticator"/>
    ```
  
-   In a JavaScript:
  
    ```js
    authenticator = context.restrictedTraverse("@@authenticator")
    url = url + "?_authenticator="  + authenticator.token()
    state.set(..., next_action='redirect_to:string:%s' % url)
    ```
  
-   In a method:
  
    ```python
    from plone.protect.utils import addTokenToUrl
    url = addTokenToUrl(url)
    ```

## `plone.app.stagingbehavior`

`plone.app.stagingbehavior` was used to enable versioning functionality for Dexterity-based content types.
It allowed you to perform the checkout and checkin operations to work on a copy of your original content on Plone 4.

The version of `plone.app.iterate` used in Plone 5 implements this already, making that package obsolete.

You should remove any hard dependency on `plone.app.stagingbehavior` from your add-on to avoid issues.

See https://github.com/collective/collective.cover/pull/577/files for an example of how to achieve that.


## Content type icons

A major breaking change from Plone 4.x to Plone 5 is how content type icons are handled.
See {ref}`content-type-icons-changed` for details.
