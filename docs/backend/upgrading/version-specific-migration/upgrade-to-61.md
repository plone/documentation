# Upgrade Plone 6.0 to 6.1

Plone 6.1 has seen the following major changes.
Some may require changes in your setup.


## Drop Python 3.8 and 3.9

We only support Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.


## TinyMCE upgraded in Classic UI

In Plone 6.0, the Classic UI frontend uses TinyMCE 5, a rich text editor for websites.
TinyMCE 5 reached its end of support on April 20, 2023.
For Plone 6.1, Classic UI upgraded TinyMCE from version 5 to 7.

If you upgrade a site using Classic UI from Plone 6.0 to 6.1, you do not need to take any action, unless you implemented custom plugins, or you use a plugin which got removed or moved to premium in TinyMCE versions 6 or 7.
To upgrade your plugin implementation to TinyMCE 7, see the [upgrade guides](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/migration-from-5x/#plugins).


### Enable the TinyMCE accordion plugin

1.  Go to the {guilabel}`Site Setup > General > TinyMCE` control panel to manage TinyMCE settings.
1.  Under the {guilabel}`Plugins and Toolbar` tab, check {guilabel}`accordion` to enable the accordion plugin.
1.  Under the same tab, add a menu entry `accordion` for TinyMCE in the control panel by editing the `items` key as shown.

    ```json
    {
      "insert": {
        "title": "Insert",
        "items": "link media | template hr | accordion"
      },
    }
    ```

1.  Click the {guilabel}`Save` button to save your settings.
1.  In the {guilabel}`Security > HTML filtering` control panel, add two new tags to {guilabel}`Valid tags`.

    -   `summary`
    -   `details`

1.  Also in the {guilabel}`Security > HTML filtering` control panel, add a new attribute to {guilabel}`Custom attributes`.

    -   `open`

1.  For a transform to valid markup of the Bootstrap 5 accordion, use an output filter.

    ```


## `z3c.form` and `plone.app.z3cform`

````{todo}
This is a placeholder.

-   Update deprecated imports
-   New widget templates

```{seealso}
https://github.com/plone/plone.app.z3cform/pull/181
```
````


## `plone.app.multilingual` is a core add-on

`plone.app.multilingual` is the package that adds multilingual support to Plone, allowing the storage and display of content in multiple languages.
In Plone 6.0 and earlier, this was a dependency of `Products.CMFPlone`, making it available for installation in all Plone sites.
In Plone 6.1 it is now a dependency of the `Plone` package.

If your project or your add-on needs this package, and you only depend on `Products.CMFPlone` until now, you should add `plone.app.multilingual` as a dependency.
Then your project or add-on will keep working in both Plone 6.0 and 6.1.

The goal of turning more of the current core packages into core add-ons is to make the core smaller, and in some cases solve circular dependencies.

## Discussion is disabled by default

Discussion is a feature that allows your site visitors to comment on web pages for any content object.
Discussion is disabled by default in Plone 6.1 and later.
To enable discussion, you need to perform the following tasks.

% Please add sufficient details for how to do this task, then delete this comment.
% Also consider that there might be different approaches between Classic UI and Volto that need to be mentioned.

1.  In your Python {file}`requirements.txt` or {file}`pyproject.toml` file, add the core add-on `plone.app.discussion` to your dependencies.
1.  Run pip to install `plone.app.discussion`.
1.  Restart the Plone backend to load `plone.app.discussion`.
1.  Enable the {guilabel}`Discussion` add-on in the Plone control panel under {menuselection}`Site Setup --> General`.
1.  🍻
