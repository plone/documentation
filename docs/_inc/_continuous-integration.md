Plone project repositories use {term}`continuous integration` (CI) to run tests, ensure code quality, or provide previews for every contribution.
Plone uses GitHub workflows, Jenkins, Cypress, Read the Docs, and other services for CI.
All of a project's CI jobs must pass before a contribution may be accepted.
