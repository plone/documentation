Installing Python is beyond the scope of this documentation.
However, it is recommended to use a Python version manager, {term}`pyenv`, that allows you to install multiple versions of Python on your development environment without destroying your system's Python.
Plone requires Python version {SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS}.
