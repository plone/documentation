# Contributing to Plone

This part of the documentation describes how to contribute to Plone, including all its projects and repositories under the Plone GitHub organization.

If instead you want to create a web application project using Plone, see {doc}`/install/create-project`.

To contribute to any project in Plone, you must follow the policies of the [Plone Foundation](https://plone.org/foundation), [Plone GitHub organization](https://github.com/plone/) and the specific project.

This chapter covers policies that apply to all Plone projects.
Other chapters cover any variations and additional policies for each project.

## Sign and return the Plone Contributor Agreement

You must give permission to the Plone Foundation to publish your contribution, according to the license we use.
Plone uses the [GNU General Public License, version 2](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/master/LICENSE) for most of its projects and for any new projects.
A few other projects use the [modified BSD license](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/), [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), or [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
You grant permission by signing and returning the Plone Contributor Agreement.

A volunteer member of the Plone Foundation will review your signed agreement.

If accepted, your GitHub account will be added to a team in the Plone GitHub organization with appropriate access, and you will simultaneously receive an email notification from GitHub.

Allow up to one week for processing.
Contact the Plone Foundation by its email address for further information, including the status of your request.

```


(contributing-code-of-conduct-label)=

## Code of Conduct

The Plone Foundation has published a [Code of Conduct](https://plone.org/foundation/materials/foundation-resolutions/code-of-conduct).
All contributors to the Plone Documentation follow the Code of Conduct.


(contributing-first-time-contributors-label)=

## First-time contributors

First-time contributors should read and follow our guide {doc}`first-time`.


(contributing-continuous-integration-label)=

## Continuous integration

Plone project repositories use continuous integration (CI) to run tests, ensure code quality, or provide previews for every contribution.
Plone uses GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Cypress, Netlify, and other services for CI.
All of a project's CI jobs must pass before a contribution may be accepted.


(contributing-change-log-label)=

## Change log entry

Plone packages require that you include a change log entry or news item with your contribution.
This is enforced by continuous integration through GitHub Actions.

Plone uses [`towncrier`](https://github.com/collective/zestreleaser.towncrier) to manage change log entries and to automatically generate history or change log files from the entries.
The log file is usually named `CHANGES.rst`, `CHANGES.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md`, and is located at the root of the package.
When a package is released with a new version, the release manager runs `towncrier` as part of the release process.
Because the log file is automatically generated, you should not edit it directly, except to make corrections, such as broken links.

To create a change log entry or news item, create a file in the `news` directory, located in the root of the package.

For Volto, its repository is in a monorepo structure, consisting of several packages in the `packages` folder.
Thus for Volto and its packages, change log entries should be created in `packages/PACKAGE_NAME/news/`, which is the root of the package.
When making a change to its documentation, set up, continuous integration, or other repository-wide items, place a change log entry in `packages/volto/news/` as a default.

The change log entry's format must be `###.type`, where `###` is the referenced GitHub issue or pull request number, `.` is the literal extension delimiter, and `type` is one of the following strings.

-   `breaking` for breaking changes
-   `bugfix` for bug fixes
-   `documentation` for documentation
-   `feature` for new features
-   `internal` for internal changes

A package configures the types it allows in a file `towncrier.toml` located at the root of its package directory.

The content of this file must include the following.

-   A brief message that summarizes the changes in your contribution.
-   An attribution to yourself, in the format of `@github_username`.

```{important}
These change log entries become narrative documentation.
```

You can write good change log entries with the following guidance.

-   Use a narrative format, in the past tense, proper English spelling and grammar, and inline markup as needed.
-   Write your change log entry for its appropriate audience.
    -   Most entries should address _users_ of the software.
    -   An entry for a change to a public API should address _developers_.
-   If you fix a bug, write what was broken and is now fixed.
-   If you add or change a feature or public API, write a summary of previous behavior, what it does now, and how to use it.
-   Refer to narrative documentation as needed.

The following text is an example of a good change log entry, placed inside {file}`/news/4470.documentation`.

```text
Changed a few broken links in `CHANGELOG.md` from URLs to inline literals to avoid errors when validating links. See https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/contributing/documentation.html#docs-linkcheckbroken for usage. @stevepiercy
```

The following would be a poor change log entry.

```text
Fix #123456 by chaning config of additionalToolbarComponents [did_not_read_this_guide]
```


(contributing-project-configuration-files-label)=

## Project configuration files

To standarize the developer experience across packages, a configuration tool is used.

See the [tool documentation](https://github.com/plone/meta) for more information.


(contributing-specific-contribution-policies-for-projects-label)=

## Specific contribution policies of projects

Each Plone project may have specific contribution policies and guidance.

## Releases

The Plone [Release Team](https://plone.org/community/teams/release-team) manages the release of new versions of Plone.

We use [`zest.releaser`](https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for releasing the Python packages used in Plone, including [Plone core (`Products.CMFPlone`)](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/), {doc}`/classic-ui/index`, {doc}`/plone.restapi/docs/source/index`, {doc}`/plone.api/index`, and {doc}`/backend/index`.
