# Plone Improvement Proposals (PLIPs)

A {term}`PLIP` is a Plone Improvement Proposal.

It is a change to a Plone package that would affect everyone.
PLIPs go through a different process than bug fixes because of their broad reach.
The Plone Framework Team reviews all PLIPs to make sure that it's in the best interest of the broader community, and that it's of high quality.

## Frequently asked questions about PLIPs

This section provides detailed answers to common questions about PLIPs.

### PLIP or bugfix?

In general, anything that changes the API of Plone in the backend or the user interface (UI) on the front end should be filed as a PLIP.
When in doubt, submit it as a PLIP.
The Framework Team will reclassify it if your proposal falls below the threshold.
If the change you are proposing is not in the scope of a PLIP, a GitHub pull request or issue is the right format.
The key point here is that each change must be documented, allowing it to be tracked and understood.

### Who can submit PLIPs?

Anyone who has signed a Plone Contributor Agreement can work on a PLIP.

You do not have to be the most amazing coder in the world to submit a PLIP.
The Framework Team is happy to help you at any point in the process.

Submitting a PLIP can be a great learning process.

When the PLIP is accepted, a Framework Team member will "champion" your PLIP and follow up to its completion.

PLIPs are not just for code experts.
If you have ideas on new interactions or UI your ideas are more than welcome.

The community will help you pair up with implementers if needed.

### What is a PLIP champion?

When you submit your PLIP and it is approved, a Framework Team member will take on the role of champion for that PLIP.

They are there to help you through completion, answer questions and provide guidance.

A champion fulfills the following tasks:

- Answer any questions the PLIP implementer has, technical or otherwise.
- Encourage the PLIP author by giving feedback and encouragement.
- Keep the implementer aware of timelines, and push to get things done on time.
- Assist with finding additional help when needed to complete the implementation in a timely matter.

Keep in mind that champions are volunteers as well, and have other tasks in life.
That means you will have to play an active role in asking for help or guidance.

### Can I get involved in other ways?

If you want to experience the process and how it works, help us review PLIPs as the implementations finish up.
Ask one of the Framework Team members what PLIPs are available for review, or check the status of PLIPs at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues) page
for [Products.CMFPlone](https://github.com/Plone/Products.CMFPlone)
for [issues tagged with "03 type: feature (plip)"](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/labels/03%20type%3A%20feature%20%28plip%29).

Make sure to let the community know you intend to review the PLIP by communicating that to the [Framework Team](https://community.plone.org/c/development/framework-team).

Then, follow the instructions for {doc}`reviewing a PLIP <plip-review>`.

Thank you in advance!

### When can I submit a PLIP?

Today, tomorrow, any time!

After the PLIP is accepted, the Framework Team will try to judge complexity and time to completion, and assign it to a milestone.

### When is the PLIP due?

**Summary: As soon as you get it done.**

Ideally, a PLIP should be completed for the release to which it's assigned.
Sometimes life gets in the way, and a PLIP may have to be re-assigned to the following release.

In general, PLIPs shouldn't take more than a year, otherwise they should be closed. A new PLIP can follow up if there is more capacity to see it through.

### What happens if your PLIP is not accepted?

If a PLIP isn't accepted in core, it doesn't mean it's a bad idea.
It is often the case that there are competing implementations, and the community wants to see it vetted as an add-on before "blessing" a particular implementation.

## Process Overview

1. Submit a PLIP at any time.
2. PLIP is approved for inclusion into core for a given release.
3. Developer implements PLIP (code, tests, documentation).
4. PLIP is submitted for review by developer.
5. Framework Team reviews the PLIP and gives feedback.
6. Developer addresses concerns in feedback and re-submits the PLIP, if necessary.
7. This may go back and forth a few times, until both the Framework Team and developer are happy with the result.
8. PLIP is approved for merge.
    In rare circumstances, a PLIP will be rejected.
    This is usually the result of the developer not responding to feedback or dropping out of the process.
    Hang in there!
9. After all other PLIPs are merged, a release is cut.
    Standby for bugs!

## How to submit a PLIP

Whether you want to update the default theme, or rip out a piece of architecture, major changes should go through the PLIP process.
If you need help at any point in this process, please contact a member of the Framework Team personally or ask for help at the [Framework Team Space](https://community.plone.org/c/development/framework-team).

A PLIP is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/new) on [`Products.CMFPlone`](https://github.com/Plone/Products.CMFPlone) with a special template and a specific tag.

To get started, open a new issue.
The issue will be prefilled with headings and comments for a bug or a PLIP.
Remove the bug part.
Fill in all applicable fields.
After submitting, select the tag `03 type: feature (plip)` for the issues.

When writing a PLIP, be as specific and to-the-point as you can.
Remember your audience.
To get support for your proposal, people will have to be able to read it!

A good PLIP is sufficiently clear for a knowledgeable Plone user to understand the proposed changes, and sufficiently detailed for the release manager and other developers to understand the full impact the proposal would have on the code base.

You don't have to list every line of code that needs to be changed, but you should also give an indication that you have some idea of how the change can be feasibly implemented.

After your PLIP is written, solicit feedback on your idea on the [Plone Community Forum](https://community.plone.org/).
In this vetting process, you want to make sure that the change won't adversely affect other people on accident.
Others may be able to point out risks or even offer up better or existing solutions.

Please note a few things:

- It is very rare that the "Risks" section will be empty or none.
- If you find this is the case, and your PLIP is anything more than trivial, maybe some more vetting should be done.
- The seconder field is REQUIRED.

The PLIP will be sent back to you if it is not filled in.
Currently, this is just someone else who thinks your PLIP is a good idea, a +1.

In the near future, the seconder should either a coding partner, or someone who is willing and able to finish the PLIP should something happen to the implementer.

### Evaluating PLIPs

After you submit your PLIP, the Framework Team will meet within a couple weeks, and let you know if the PLIP is accepted.
If the PLIP is not accepted, please don't be discouraged!

Most PLIPs first start as an add-on, if possible, to make sure it works in practice.

All communication with you occurs on the PLIP issue itself.
Please keep your eyes and inbox open for changes.

These are the criteria by which the framework team will review your work:

- What is the size and status of the work needed to be done?
- Is it already an add-on and well established?
- Is this idea well baked and expressed clearly?
- Does the work proposed belong in Plone now, or in the future?
- Is this PLIP more appropriate as a qualified add-on?
- Is this PLIP too risky?

See the {doc}`plip-review` page for more information.

## Implementing your PLIP

You can start the development at any time, but if you are going to modify Plone itself, it is a good idea to wait to see if your idea is approved.

### General Rules

- Any new packages must be in a branch in the `plone` namespace in GitHub.
    You don't have to develop there, but it must be there when submitted.
    Use branches off of the repositories under the Plone GitHub organization, see below.
- Most importantly, the PLIP reviewers must be able run buildout and everything should "just work"â„¢.
- Any new code must:

  - Be {doc}`properly documented <documentation>`.
  - Have clear code.
  - Follow current best practices in coding style. The [Plone Meta](https://github.com/plone/meta) project can help you set up your environment. For Volto, follow [this guide](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/contributing/linting.html).
  - [Be tested](https://5.docs.plone.org/develop/testing/index.html). For Volto, follow [this guide](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/contributing/testing.html)

```{todo}
Update links from Plone 5 to Plone 6 Documentation, once content is migrated.
See https://github.com/plone/documentation/issues/1330 and other issues.
```

### Creating a new PLIP branch

Create a buildout configuration file for your PLIP in the `plips` folder of {file}`buildout.coredev`.

Give it a descriptive name, starting with the PLIP number, for example, {file}`plip-1234-widget-frobbing.cfg`.

The PLIP number is your PLIP's issue number.

This file will define the branches you're working with in your PLIP, along with other buildout configuration.

It should look something like the following, such as in a file {file}`plips/plip-1234-widget-frobbing.cfg`.

```ini
[buildout]
extends = plipbase.cfg
auto-checkout +=
    plone.somepackage
    plone.app.someotherpackage

[sources]
plone.somepackage = git https://github.com/plone/plone.somepackage.git branch=plip-1234-widget-frobbing
plone.app.someotherpackage = git https://github.com/plone/plone.app.somepackage.git branch=plip-1234-widget-frobbing

[instance]
eggs +=
    plone.somepackage
    plone.app.someotherpackage
zcml +=
    plone.somepackage
    plone.app.someotherpackage
```

Use the same naming convention when you branch existing packages.
You should always branch packages when working on PLIPs.

### Working on a PLIP

To work on a PLIP, you bootstrap buildout, and then invoke buildout with your PLIP configuration:

```shell
virtualenv .
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
./bin/buildout -c plips/plip-1234-widget-frobbing.cfg
```

If you are using a {file}`local.cfg` to extend your PLIP file with some changes that you do not want to commit accidentally, be aware that you need to override some settings from {file}`plipbase.cfg` to avoid some files being created in the {file}`plips` directory or in the directory above the buildout directory.
This is done as shown below.

```ini
[buildout]
extends = plips/plip-1234-widget-frobbing.cfg
develop-eggs-directory = ./develop-eggs
bin-directory = ./bin
parts-directory = ./parts
sources-dir = ./src
installed = .installed.cfg

[instance]
var = ./var
```

### Finishing up

Before marking your PLIP as ready for review, please add a file to give a set of instructions to the PLIP reviewer.
This file should be called {file}`plip_<number>_notes.txt`.
This should include, but is not limited to:

- URLs pointing to all documentation created and updated
- Any concerns and issues still remaining
- Any weird buildout things

Once you have finished, update your PLIP issue to indicate that it is ready for review.
The Framework Team will assign 2-3 people to review your PLIP.
They will follow the guidelines listed at {doc}`plip-review`.

After the PLIP has been accepted by the Framework Team and the release managers, you will be asked to merge your work into the main development line.
Merging the PLIP in is not the hardest part, but you must think about it when you develop.

You'll have to interact with a large number of people to get it all set up.

The merge may have unintended interactions with other PLIPs coming in.
During the merge phase you must be prepared to help out with all the features and bugs that arise.

If all went as planned, the next Plone release will carry on with your PLIP in it.
You'll be expected to help out with that feature after it's been released (within reason).
