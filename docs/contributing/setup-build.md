# Building and Checking the Quality of Documentation

This document covers how to build the Plone Documentation and check it for quality.


(setup-build-installation-label)=

## Installation

Install [Enchant](https://abiword.github.io/enchant/) to check spelling.

**macOS**

```shell
brew install enchant
```

**Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt-get install enchant
```

```{note}
If you are using an M1 Mac to build the documentation, there is currently [an issue with pyenchant](https://github.com/pyenchant/pyenchant/issues/265) that throws an error that the enchant library can't be found.
This happens for example if you install Python 3 with `pyenv` in the default M1 architecture (aarch64), so without following instructions to use Rosetta2 x86 emulation.
A workaround until pyenchant is fixed is to run `export PYENCHANT_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libenchant-2.dylib` in the terminal session before you execute `make html`.
```

Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) for graph visualization.

**macOS**

```shell
brew install graphviz
```

**Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

Clone the Plone Documentation repository, and change your working directory into the cloned project.
Then with a single command using `Makefile`, create a Python virtual environment, install project dependencies, pull in Volto documentation as a git submodule, build the docs, and view the results in a web browser by opening `/_build/html/index.html`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/plone/documentation.git
cd documentation
make html
```

(setup-build-available-documentation-builds-label)=

## Available documentation builds

All build and check documentation commands use the file `Makefile`.

To see the most frequently used builds, use the following command.

```shell
make help
```

Else you can open `Makefile` to see other build formats, including PDF.


### `html`

`html` is the HTML version of the documentation.

```shell
make html
```

Open `/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.


### `livehtml`

`livehtml` rebuilds Sphinx documentation on changes, with live-reload in the browser.

```shell
make livehtml
```

Open http://0.0.0.0:8000/ in a web browser.


### `linkcheck`

`linkcheck` checks all links.
See {ref}`authors-linkcheck-label` for configuration.

```shell
make linkcheck
```

Open `/_build/linkcheck/output.txt` for a list of broken links.


### `spellcheck`

`spellcheck` checks the spelling of words.
See {ref}`authors-english-label` for configuration.

```shell
make spellcheck
```

Open `/_build/spellcheck/` for misspellings.


### `html_meta`

`html_meta` adds a meta data section to each chapter if missing.
See {ref}`authors-html-meta-data-label` for more info.

```shell
make html_meta
```
