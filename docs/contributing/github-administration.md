: repositories that are not part of the default Volto installation, but extend its functionality

`classic ui`
: counterpart to `volto` tag

`classic ui add-ons`
: counterpart to `volto add-ons` tag

`documentation`
: repositories that have documentation

`training`
: repositories related to the training documentation

`infrastructure`
: repositories used for maintaining Plone servers

`tooling`
