# `plone/plone-frontend`

This chapter covers the Plone 6 default frontend [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image using Node.
The frontend is written using React and requires a Plone backend to be running and accessible.

This image is **not a base image** to be extended in your projects, but an example of the Plone user experience out of the box.


## Configuration Variables


### Main variables


| Environment variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAZZLE_API_PATH` | Used to generate frontend calls to the backend. Needs to be a public URL accessible by client browser. | `http://api.site.org/++api++/` |
| `RAZZLE_INTERNAL_API_PATH` | Used by the middleware to construct requests to the backend. It can be a non-public address. | `http://backend:8080/Plone` |
| `VOLTO_ROBOTSTXT` | Override the `robots.txt` file. | `"User-agent: *\nDisallow: "` |

```{note}
For an extensive list of environment variables used by the frontend, visit {doc}`/volto/configuration/environmentvariables`.
```


## Using as an example for your Volto project

To use this image as an example of a Docker image for your own Volto project, you will need to edit the file `Dockerfile` in your project.
`Dockerfile` is pulled from the root of the [`plone/plone-frontend`](https://github.com/plone/plone-frontend/) repository.

```{note}
The examples for `Dockerfile` in this documentation use Volto 15.x.
You might need to adapt the examples for more recent releases.
```

In `Dockerfile` replace the `yo @plone/volto` command with the `COPY . /build/plone-frontend` command.

```diff
   # Generate new volto app
-  RUN yo @plone/volto \
+  RUN COPY . /build/plone-frontend \
     plone-frontend \
```

### Create a custom entry point

The `plone-frontend` Docker image does not have a custom entry point file.
For any commands you need to run when starting your Docker container, you will need to create it.

After creating the `entrypoint.sh` file, make sure it has the execute permission:

```shell
chmod 755 entrypoint.sh
```

```{note}
Do not forget to add the `exec "$@"` command at the end of the `entrypoint.sh` file to run the default `yarn start` command.
```

In the `Dockerfile` you will need to add two commands to make the Docker container run `entrypoint.sh` on start:

```diff
      --no-interactive
+
+ COPY entrypoint.sh /

  RUN cd plone-frontend \
```

```diff
  CMD ["yarn", "start:prod"]
+ ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```


### Build

Build your new image.

```shell
docker build . -t myfrontend:latest -f Dockerfile
```


### Start it

You can use it in the following `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:

  backend:
    image: plone/plone-backend:6.0.0a6
    # Plone 5.2 series can be used too
    # image: plone/plone-backend:5.2.7
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    environment:
      - SITE=Plone
      - 'ADDONS=plone.restapi==8.21.0 plone.volto==4.0.0a3 plone.rest==2.0.0a2 plone.app.iterate==4.0.2 plone.app.vocabularies==4.3.0'
      - 'PROFILES=plone.volto:default-homepage'

  frontend:
    image: 'myfrontend:latest'
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: always
    environment:
      # These are needed in a Docker environment since the
      # routing needs to be amended. You can point to the
      # internal network alias.
      RAZZLE_INTERNAL_API_PATH: http://backend:8080/Plone
      RAZZLE_DEV_PROXY_API_PATH: http://backend:8080/Plone
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

To start, run the following command.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
