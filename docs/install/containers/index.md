# Containers

Using containers is the easiest way to try out and deploy Plone 6.

The community provides official images that could be used for standalone Plone installations.
These images support a variety of installation options.
You can choose from Classic UI or the new frontend, or specialized databases using ZEO or a relational database.

## Getting started

```{note}
Although there are many container engine tools for developing, managing, and running containers, we will use {term}`Docker` in this documentation.
```

### System requirements

The system requirements include those required by Docker itself.

-   [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
-   [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
-   [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Plone 6 itself requires memory and disk space in addition to those of Docker alone.
See its {ref}`install-packages-hardware-requirements-label`.


### Install Docker

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

Docker Desktop includes all Docker tools.
{term}`Docker Compose` is one of the Docker tools that will be used in much of this documentation.


### Start Plone

First start the Plone Backend, naming it `plone6-backend` and creating a site with its default configuration, using the following command.

```shell
docker run --name plone6-backend -e SITE=Plone -d -p 8080:8080 plone/plone-backend:{PLONE_BACKEND_MINOR_VERSION}
```

Now start the Plone Frontend, linking it to the `plone6-backend`:

```shell
docker run --name plone6-frontend --link plone6-backend:backend -e RAZZLE_DEV_PROXY_API_PATH=http://backend:8080/Plone -d -p 3000:3000 plone/plone-frontend:latest
```


## Access your Plone site

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the new Plone site.

```{note}
The default user is `admin` and the password is `admin`.
```


## Shutdown and cleanup

To stop and clean up the containers use the following commands.

```shell
docker stop plone6-frontend && docker rm plone6-frontend
docker stop plone6-backend && docker rm plone6-backend
```


## Next steps

Get to know the [Official Images](images/index) maintained by the Plone community.

Also see some [examples](examples/index) of how to use the Official Images to bootstrap your projects.
