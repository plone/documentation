# Orchestration

This page covers orchestration of a Plone 6 application.

The recommended procedure for Plone 6 is through the use of Docker Swarm.

```{seealso}
Kubernetes is another orchestration option currently under development and testing in the [Plone Helm Charts](https://github.com/plone/helm-charts) GitHub repository.
```
