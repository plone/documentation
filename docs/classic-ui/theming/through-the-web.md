# Through-the-web (TTW) theme customization

```{todo}
This page is only an outline and needs a lot of work.
See https://github.com/plone/documentation/issues/1286
```

TTW customization is useful when you need to make small CSS changes.
Theme changes can be made via control panels or by updating Plone 6 Classic UI's `custom.css`.
Other theming methods should be used for larger customizations or entire website designs.
