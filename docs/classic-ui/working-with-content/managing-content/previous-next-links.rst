.. _rst_prev-next-links:

Next/Previous Navigation
========================

Automatic previous-next links for content items in a folder can be enabled under the Settings tab for a folder.

The *Settings* tab is found by clicking the *Edit* tab for the folder.

Once enabled, as content items are added to the folder, previous and next links will automatically appear at the bottom of each content item.

This is a *really* useful feature!
