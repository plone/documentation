Reordering Items
=====================

Using "Contents" on the Toolbar gives you the overview of a folder. From here, you can do manual reordering of items in a folder.

   :align: center
   :alt: reordering content

   Simply hover over the content item you want to reorder (any column is fine, just don't hover exactly over the title), and the cursor changes into a hand. Click and drag to reorder.
