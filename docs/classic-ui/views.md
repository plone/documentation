# Views

`Views` are the basic elements of modern Python web frameworks. A view runs code to setup Python variables for a rendering template.The output is not limited to HTML pages and snippets, but may contain {term}`JSON`, file download payloads, or other data formats.

Views are usually a combination of:

- a Python class, which performs the user interface logic setup, and
- corresponding {ref}`plone:classic-ui-templates-label`, or direct Python string output.

```{eval-rst}
.. graphviz::
  :align: center

   digraph viewstructure {
      {
        node [margin=5,shape=box]
      }
      ZCML -> {Python, Template};
   }
```


Templates should kept simple and logic kept in a separate Python file. This enhances readability and makes components more reusable. You can override the Python logic or the template file, or both.

When you are working with Plone, the most common view type is `BrowserView`
from the [Products.Five](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/src/Products/Five/doc/manual.txt) package. Other view types are `DefaultView` from [plone.dexterity](https://github.com/plone/plone.dexterity/blob/master/plone/dexterity/browser/view.py) and `CollectionView` from [plone.app.contenttypes](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/blob/master/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/collection.py) package.

Each `BrowserView` class is a Python callable.
The `BrowserView.__call__()` method acts as an entry point to executing
the view code. From Zope's point of view, even a function would be
sufficient, as it is a callable.

## Creating and registering a view

This shows how to create and register view in Plone.

### Creating a view

Create your add-on package using {term}`plonecli`:

```shell

$ plonecli create addon collective.awesomeaddon
```

then change the directory into the created package and add a view:

```shell

$ plonecli add view
```

#### Python logic code

Depending how you answered the questions, `plonecli` will generate a Python file like this for you `src/collective/awesomeaddon/views/my_view.py`:

```python

# from p6.docs import _
from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView
from zope.interface import Interface

# from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile


class IMyView(Interface):
    """Marker Interface for IMyView"""


class MyView(BrowserView):
    # If you want to define a template here, please remove the template attribute from
    # the configure.zcml registration of this view.
    # template = ViewPageTemplateFile('my_view.pt')

    def __call__(self):
        # your code here

        # render the template
        return self.index()
```

```{warning}
Do not attempt to run any code in the `__init__()` method of a
view.  If this code fails and an exception is raised, the
`zope.component` machinery remaps this to a "View not found"
exception or traversal error.

Additionally, view class may be instantiated in other places than where
you intended to render the view.
For example, plone.app.contentmenu does this when creating the menu to
select a view layout.
This will result in the `__init__()` being called on unexpected
contexts, probably wasting a lot of time.

Instead, use a pattern where you have a `setup()` or similar
method which `__call__()` or view users can explicitly call.
```

#### Registering a view

```{todo}
Fix references in this section
```

Zope 3 views are registered in {term}`ZCML`, an XML-based configuration
language.  `plonecli` did the following registration in `src/collective/awesomeaddon/views/configure.zcml` for you.

The following example registers a new view (see below for comments):

```xml
<configure
      xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
      xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
      >

    <browser:page
          for="*"
          name="myview"
          permission="zope2.Public"
          class=".views.MyView"
          />

  <browser:page
    name="my-view"
    for="*"
    class=".my_view.MyView"
    template="my_view.pt"
    permission="zope2.View"
    layer="collective.awesomeaddon.interfaces.ICollectiveAwesomeaddonLayer"
    />

</configure>
```

`for`

: specifies which content types receive this view.
  `for="*"` means that this view can be used for any content type. This
  is the same as registering views to the `zope.interface.Interface`
  base class.

`name`

: is the name by which the view is exposed to traversal and
  `getMultiAdapter()` look-ups. If your view's name is `myview`, then
  you can render it in the browser by calling
  <http://yourhost/site/page/@@myview>

`permission`
: is the permission needed to access the view.
  When an HTTP request comes in, the currently logged in user's access
  rights in the current context are checked against this permission.
  See {doc}`Security chapter </develop/plone/security/permission_lists>` for Plone's
  out-of-the-box permissions. Usually you want have `zope2.View`,
  `cmf.ModifyPortalContent`, `cmf.ManagePortal` or `zope2.Public`
  here.

`class`

: is a Python dotted name for a class based on `BrowserView`, which is
  responsible for managing the view. The Class's `__call__()` method is
  the entry point for view processing and rendering.

```{Note}
You need to declare the `browser` namespace in your
`configure.zcml` to use `browser` configuration directives.
```

The view in question is registered against a {ref}`classic-ui-layers-label`, it will be available after restart, after you run {doc}`Add/remove in Site setup </develop/addons/components/genericsetup>`.


#### Page template

Depending on how you answered the questions, `plonecli` was creating a {ref}`template <plone:classic-ui-templates-label>` for you.

`src/collective/awesomeaddon/views/my_view.pt`:

```xml
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:metal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/metal"
      xmlns:tal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal"
      xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
      i18n:domain="p6.docs"
      metal:use-macro="context/main_template/macros/master">
<body>
  <metal:content-core fill-slot="content-core">
  <metal:block define-macro="content-core">

      <h2 i18n:translate="">Sample View</h2>
      <!--<div tal:replace="view/my_custom_view_method" />-->
      <!--<div tal:replace="context/my_custom_field" />-->

  </metal:block>
  </metal:content-core>
</body>
</html>
```

When you restart Plone, and activate your add-on, the view should be available through your browser.

#### Accessing your newly created view

Now you can access your view within the news folder:

```
http://localhost:8080/Plone/news/my-view
```

... or on a site root:

```
http://localhost:8080/Plone/my-view
```

... or on any other content item.

You can also use the `@@` notation at the front of the view name to make
sure that you are looking up a *view*, and not a content item that happens
to have the same id as a view:

```
http://localhost:8080/Plone/news/@@my-view
```

### Content slots

```{todo}
Fix references in this section
```

Available {doc}`slot </adapt-and-extend/theming/templates_css/template_basics>`
options you can use for `<metal fill-slot="">` in your template which
inherits from `<html metal:use-macro="context/main_template/macros/master">`:

`content`

: render edit border yourself

`main`

: overrides main slot in main template; you must render title and description yourself

`content-title`

: title and description prerendered, Plone version > 4.x

`content-core`

: content body specific to your view, Plone version > 4.x

`header`

: A slot for inserting content above the title; may be useful in conjunction with
  content-core slot if you wish to use the stock content-title provided by the
  main template.

### Relationship between views and templates

The ZCML `<browser:view template="">` directive will set the `index`
class attribute.

The default view's `__call__()` method will return the value
returned by a call to `self.index()`.

Example: this ZCML configuration:

```xml
<browser:page
    for="*"
    name="myview"
    permission="zope2.Public"
    class=".views.MyView"
    />
```

and this Python code:

```
from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView
from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

class MyView(BrowserView):

    index = ViewPageTemplateFile("my-template.pt")
```

is equal to this ZCML configuration:

```
<browser:page
    for="*"
    name="myview"
    permission="zope2.Public"
    class=".views.MyView"
    template="my-template.pt"
    />
```

and this Python code:

```
class MyView(BrowserView):
    pass
```

Rendering of the view is done as follows:

```
from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

class MyView(BrowserView):

    # This may be overridden in ZCML
    index = ViewPageTemplateFile("my-template.pt")

    def render(self):
        return self.index()

    def __call__(self):
        return self.render()
```


### Several templates per view

You can bind several templates to one view and render them individually.
This is useful for reusable templating, or when you subclass
your functional views.

```
from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView
from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile


class CourseTimetables(BrowserView):

    template1 = ViewPageTemplateFile('template1.pt')
    template2 = ViewPageTemplateFile('template2.pt')

    def render_template1(self):
        return self.template1.render(self)

    def render_template2(self):
        return self.template2.render(self)
```

And then in the template call:

```html
<div tal:replace="structure view/render_template1">

<div tal:replace="structure view/render_template2">
```

#### View `__init__()` method special cases

```{todo}
Fix references in this section
```

The Python constructor method of the view, `__init__()`, is special.
You should almost never try to put your code there. Instead, use the `_call__()` method or further helper methods called from it.

The `__init__()` method of the view might not have an {doc}`acquisition chain </develop/plone/serving/traversing>`
available, meaning that it does not know the parent or hierarchy where the view is. This also means that you don't have user infos and permissions here.

This information is set after the constructor have been run.
All Plone code which relies on acquisition chain, which means almost all Plone helper code, does not work in `__init__()`.
Thus, the called Plone API methods return `None` or tend to throw exceptions.

### Layers

Views can be registered against a specific {ref}`layer <classic-ui-layers-label>` interface.
This means that views are only looked up if the specified layer is in use.
Since one Zope application server can contain multiple Plone sites, layers
are used to determine which Python code is in effect for a given Plone site.

A layer is in use when:

- a theme which defines that layer is active, or
- if a specific add-on product which defines that layer is installed.

You should register your views against a certain layer in your own code.

For more information, read the {ref}`classic-ui-layers-label` chapter.


### Register and unregister view directly using zope.component architecture

Example how to register:

```
import zope.component
import zope.publisher.interfaces.browser

zope.component.provideAdapter(
    # Our class
    factory=TestingRedirectHandler,
    # (context, request) layers for multiadapter lookup
    # We provide None as layers are not used
    adapts=(None, None),
    # All views are registered as IBrowserView interface
    provides=zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView,
    # View name
    name='redirect_handler')
```

Example how to unregister:

```
# Dynamically unregister a view
gsm = zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager()
gsm.unregisterAdapter(factory=TestingRedirectHandler,
                      required=(None, None),
                      provided=zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView,
                      name="redirect_handler")
```

## Customizing views

To customize existing Plone core or add-on views you have different options.

- Usually you can simply override the related page template file (`.pt`).
- Sometimes you need to change the related Python view class code also.
  In this case, you override the Python class by using your own add-on which
  installs a view class replacement using an add-on specific `browser layer`.

### Overriding view template

The recommended approach to customize `.pt` files for Plone is to use a little helper called [z3c.jbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot).

If you need to override templates in core Plone or in an existing add-on, you can do the following:

- Create your own add-on with {term}`plonecli`
  which you can use to contain your page templates on the file system.
- The created package already contains an overrides folder for [z3c.jbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot) in browser/overrides, where you can place your template overrides.
- [z3c.jbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot) can override page templates (`.pt` files) for views,
  viewlets, old style page templates and portlets.
  In fact it can override any `.pt` file in the Plone source tree, except the main_template.pt.

### Overriding a template using z3c.jbot

  1. First of all, make sure that your customization add-on supports [z3c.jbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot).
  Add-on packages created by plonecli have an `overrides` folder in the `browser` folder where you can
  drop in your new `.pt` files.

2. Locate the template you need to override in Plone source tree.
  You can do this by searching the in all installed packages for `.pt` files. If you are using buildout with the `collective.recipe.omelette` recipe, a good folder to search in is `./parts/omelette`.

Below is an example UNIX `find` command to find `.pt` files.

You can also use Windows Explorer file search or similar tools:

  ```shell
  $ find -L ./parts/omelette -name "*.pt"
  ...
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/listing_album.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/listing.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/newsitem.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/full_view.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/full_view_item.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/document.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/image_view_fullscreen.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/link.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/file.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/listing_summary.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/listing_tabular.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/browser/templates/image.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/behaviors/richtext_gettext.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contenttypes/behaviors/leadimage.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contentrules/browser/templates/manage-elements.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contentrules/browser/templates/controlpanel.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contentrules/browser/templates/contentrules-pageform.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contentrules/browser/templates/manage-assignments.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/contentrules/actions/templates/mail.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/viewletmanager/manage-viewlets.pt
  ./parts/omelette/plone/app/viewletmanager/manage-viewletmanager.pt
  ...
  ```

3. Make a copy of the `.pt` file you want to override. To override a particular file, first determine its canonical filename. It’s defined as the path relative to the package within which the file is located; directory separators are replaced with dots.

  Suppose you want to override: `plone/app/layout/viewlets/logo.pt`

  You would use the filename: `plone.app.layout.viewlets.logo.pt`


  Drop the file in the registered `overrides` folder in your add-on.

  Make your changes in the new `.pt` file.

  ```{note}
  After overriding the template for the first time (adding the file to the `overrides` folder) you need to restart Plone. [z3c.jbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot) scans new overrides only during the restart.
  ```

After the file is in place, changes to the file are instantly picked up. The template code is re-read on every HTTP request.

If you want to override an already overridden template, read here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16209392/how-can-i-override-an-already-overriden-template-by-jbot


## Overriding a view class

In this example we override the `@@register` form from the
`plone.app.users` package, creating a custom form which subclasses the
original. Given you have a Plone add-on packages created with {term}`plonecli`. You'll have the following browser layer interface and it's registration in `profiles/default/browserlayer.xml` already in place.

- Create an interface in `interfaces.py`:

  ```
  from plone.theme.interfaces import IDefaultPloneLayer

  class ICollectiveAwesomeaddon(IDefaultPloneLayer):
      """ A marker interface for the theme layer
      """
  ```

- Then create `profiles/default/browserlayer.xml`:

```xml
<layers>
  <layer
    name="collective.awesomeaddon"
    interface="collective.awesomeaddon.interfaces.ICollectiveAwesomeaddon"
  />
</layers>
```

- Create `views/configure.zcml`:

```xml
<configure
    xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
    xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
    i18n_domain="collective.awesomeaddon">

  <browser:page
      name="register"
      class=".customregistration.CustomRegistrationForm"
      permission="cmf.AddPortalMember"
      for="plone.app.layout.navigation.interfaces.INavigationRoot"
      layer="collective.awesomeaddon.interfaces.ICollectiveAwesomeaddon"
      />

</configure>
```

```{note}
We've retained the permissions and marker interface of the original view.
You may provide a specific permission or marker interface instead of these
as your product requires.
```

- Create `views/customregistration.py`:

  ```
  from plone.app.users.browser.register import RegistrationForm

  class CustomRegistrationForm(RegistrationForm):
      """ Subclass the standard registration form
      """
  ```

```{note}
You can also add a view to your package via {term}`plonecli` and place the Python code and ZCML registration in the generated view files as shown above. This way you also have a test for the view generated.
```







## Guided information

The Mastering Plone Training has several chapters on views.

- {ref}`training:views1-label`
- {ref}`training:views2-label`
- {ref}`training:views3-label`


## Anatomy of a view

```{todo}
Fix references in this section
```

Views are Zope Component Architecture ({term}`ZCA`) *multi-adapter
registrations*.

Views are looked up by name. The Zope publisher always does a view lookup,
instead of traversing, if the name to be traversed is prefixed with `@@`.

Views are resolved with three inputs:

`context`

: Any class/interface for which the view applies. If not given, `zope.interface.Interface`
  is used (corresponds to a registration `for="*"`). Usually this is a content item
  instance.

`request`

: The current HTTP request. Interface
  `zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest` is used.

`layer`

: Theme layer and addon layer interface. If not given,
  `zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IDefaultBrowserLayer` is used.

Views return HTTP request payload as the output. Returned
strings are turned to HTML page responses.

Views can be any Python class taking in (context, request) construction parameters. Minimal view would be:

```
class MyView(object):

     def __init__(self, context, request):
          self.context = context
          self.request = request

     def __call__(self):
          return "Hello world. You are rendering this view at the context of %s" % self.context
```

However, in the most of cases

- Full Plone page views are subclass of [Products.Five.browser.BrowserView](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/src/Products/Five/browser/__init__.py#L23)
  which is a wrapper class. It wraps [zope.publisher.browser.BrowserView](https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.publisher/blob/master/src/zope/publisher/browser.py#L896)
  and adds an acquisition (parent traversal) support for it.
- Views have `index` attribute which points to {doc}`TAL page template </adapt-and-extend/theming/templates_css/template_basics>`
  responsible rendering the HTML code. You get the HTML output by doing self.index() and page template
  gets a context argument `view` pointing to the view class instance. `index` value
  is usually instance of [Products.Five.browser.pagetemplate.ViewPageTemplateFile](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/src/Products/Five/browser/pagetemplatefile.py#L33)
  (full Plone pages) or [zope.pagetemplate.pagetemplatefile.PageTemplateFile](https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.pagetemplate/blob/master/src/zope/pagetemplate/pagetemplatefile.py#L40)
  (HTML snippets, no acquisition)
- View classes should implement {doc}`interface </develop/addons/components/interfaces>`
  [zope.browser.interfaces.IBrowserView](https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.browser/blob/master/src/zope/browser/interfaces.py#L27)

Views rendering page snippets and parts can be subclasses of zope.publisher.browser.BrowserView directly
as snippets might not need acquisition support which adds some overhead to the rendering process.

## Helper views

Not all views need to return HTML output, or output at all.
Views can beused as helpers in the code to provide APIs to objects. Since views
can be overridden using layers, a view is a natural plug-in point which an
add-on product can customize or override in a conflict-free manner.

View methods are exposed to page templates and such, so you can also call
view methods directly from a page template, not only from Python code.

### More information

- {doc}`Context helpers </develop/plone/misc/context>`
- {doc}`Expressions </develop/plone/functionality/expressions>`

### Historical perspective

Often, the point of using helper views is that you can have reusable
functionality which can be plugged in as one-line code around the system.
Helper views also get around the following limitations:

- TAL security.
- Limiting Python expression to one line.
- Not being able to import Python modules.

```{Note}
Using `RestrictedPython` scripts (creating Python through the
Management Interface) and Zope 2 Extension modules is discouraged.
The same functionality can be achieved with helper views, with less
potential pitfalls.
```

## Reusing view template snippets or embedding another view

To use the same template code several times you can either:

- create a separate `BrowserView` for it and then call this view (see
  [Accessing a view instance in code] below);
- share a `ViewPageTemplate` instance between views and using it several
  times.

```{Note}
The Plone 2.x way of doing this with TAL template language macros is
discouraged as a way to provide reusable functionality in your add-on
product.
This is because macros are hardwired to the TAL template language, and
referring to them outside templates is difficult.

If you ever need to change the template language, or mix in other
template languages, you can do better when templates are a
feature of a pure Python based view, and not vice versa.
```

Here is an example of how to have a view snippet which can be used by
subclasses of a base view class. Subclasses can refer to this template
at any point of the view rendering, making it possible for subclasses
to have fine-tuned control over how the template snippet is
represented.

Related Python code:

```
from Products.Five import BrowserView
from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

class ProductCardView(BrowserView):
    """
    End user visible product card presentation.
    """
    implements(IProductCardView)

    # Nested template which renders address box + buy button
    summary_template = ViewPageTemplateFile("summarybox.pt")


    def renderSummary(self):
        """ Render summary box

        @return: Resulting HTML code as Python string
        """
        return self.summary_template()
```

Then you can render the summary template in the main template associated
with `ProductCardView` by calling the `renderSummary()` method and TAL
non-escaping HTML embedding.

```html
<h1 tal:content="context/Title" />

<div tal:replace="structure view/renderSummary" />

<div class="description">
    <div tal:condition="python:context.Description().decode('utf-8') != u'None'" tal:replace="structure context/Description" />
</div>
```

The `summarybox.pt` itself is a piece of HTML code without the
Plone decoration frame (`main_template/master` etc. macros).  Make sure
that you declare the `i18n:domain` again, or the strings in this
template will not be translated.

```html
<div class="summary-box" i18n:domain="your.package">
    ...
</div>
```

## Accessing a view instance in code

You need to get access to the view in your code if you are:

- calling a view from inside another view, or
- calling a view from your unit test code.

Below are two different approaches for that.

### By using `getMultiAdapter()`

This is the most efficient way in Python.

Example:

```
from Acquisition import aq_inner
from zope.component import getMultiAdapter

def getView(context, request, name):
    # Remove the acquisition wrapper (prevent false context assumptions)
    context = aq_inner(context)
    # May raise ComponentLookUpError
    view = getMultiAdapter((context, request), name=name)
    # Add the view to the acquisition chain
    view = view.__of__(context)
    return view
```

### By using traversal

Traversal is slower than directly calling `getMultiAdapter()`.  However,
traversal is readily available in templates and `RestrictedPython`
modules.

Example:

```
def getView(context, name):
    """ Return a view associated with the context and current HTTP request.

    @param context: Any Plone content object.
    @param name: Attribute name holding the view name.
    """

    try:
        view = context.unrestrictedTraverse("@@" + name)
    except AttributeError:
        raise RuntimeError("Instance %s did not have view %s" % (str(context), name))

    view = view.__of__(context)

    return view
```

You can also do direct view look-ups and method calls in your template
by using the `@@`-notation in traversing.

```html
<div tal:attributes="lang context/@@plone_portal_state/current_language">
    We look up lang attribute by using BrowserView which name is "plone_portal_state"
</div>
```

### Use a skin-based template in a Five view

Use `aq_acquire(object, template_name)`.

Example: Get an object by its path and render it using its default
template in the current context.

```python
from Acquisition import aq_base, aq_acquire
from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

class TelescopeView(BrowserView):
    """
    Renders an object in a different location of the site when passed the
    path to it in the querystring.
    """
    def __call__(self):
        path = self.request["path"]
        target_obj = self.context.restrictedTraverse(path)
        # Strip the target_obj of context with aq_base.
        # Put the target in the context of self.context.
        # getDefaultLayout returns the name of the default
        # view method from the factory type information
        return aq_acquire(aq_base(target_obj).__of__(self.context),
                          target_obj.getDefaultLayout())()
```

### Listing available views

This is useful for debugging purposes:

```
from plone.app.customerize import registration
from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserRequest

# views is generator of zope.component.registry.AdapterRegistration objects
views = registration.getViews(IBrowserRequest)
```

#### Listing all views of certain type

How to filter out views which provide a certain interface:

```
from plone.app.customerize import registration
from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserRequest

# views is generator of zope.component.registry.AdapterRegistration objects
views = registration.getViews(IBrowserRequest)

# Filter out all classes which implement a certain interface
views = [ view.factory for view in views if IBlocksView.implementedBy(view.factory) ]
```

### Default view of a content item

```{todo}
Fix references in this section
```

Objects have views for default, view, edit, and so on.

The distinction between the `default` and `view` views are that for files,
the default can be `download`.

The default view ...

- This view is configured in {ref}`backend-content-types-label`.
- This view is rendered when a content item is called --- even though they are objects, they have the `__call__()` Python method defined.

If you need to get a content item's view for page
rendering explicitly, you can do it as follows:

```
def viewURLFor(item):
    cstate = getMultiAdapter((item, item.REQUEST),
                             name='plone_context_state')
    return cstate.view_url()
```

### Allowing the contentmenu on non-default views

In general, the contentmenu (where the actions, display views, factory types,
workflow, and other dropdowns are) is not shown on non-default views. There are
some exceptions, though.

If you want to display the contentmenu in such non-default views, you have to
mark them with the IViewView interface from plone.app.layout either by letting
the class provide IViewView by declaring it with zope.component.implements or
by configuring it via ZCML like so:

```
<class class="dotted.path.to.browser.view.class">
  <implements interface="plone.app.layout.globals.interfaces.IViewView" />
</class>
```

## Zope ViewPageTemplateFile vs. Five ViewPageTemplateFile

```{warning}
There are two different classes that share the same `ViewPageTemplateFile` name.
```

- Zope  [BrowserView source code](https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.publisher/blob/master/src/zope/publisher/browser.py).
- [Five version](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/src/Products/Five/browser/__init__.py).
  [Products.Five](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/src/Products/Five/doc/manual.txt) is a way to access some Zope 3 technologies from the Zope
  2 codebase, which is used by Plone.

Difference in code:

```
from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile
```

vs.:

```
from zope.app.pagetemplate import ViewPageTemplateFile
```

The difference is that the *Five* version supports:

- Acquisition.
- The `provider:` TAL expression.
- Other Plone-specific TAL expression functions like `test()`.
- Usually, Plone code needs the Five version of `ViewPageTemplateFile`.
- Some subsystems, notably the `z3c.form` package, expect the Zope 3
  version of `ViewPageTemplateFile` instances.


### Views and automatic member variable acquisition wrapping

View class instances will automatically assign themselves as a parent for all member
variables. This is because `five` package based views inherit from `Acquisition.Implicit` base class.

.. todo::

    this is an todo

E.g. you have a `Basket` content item with `absolute_url()` of:

```
http://localhost:9666/isleofback/sisalto/matkasuunnitelmat/d59ca034c50995d6a77cacbe03e718de
```

Then if you use this object in a view code's member variable assignment in e.g. `Viewlet.update() method`:

```
self.basket = my_basket
```

... this will mess up the Basket content item's acquisition chain:

```
<Basket at /isleofback/sisalto/yritykset/katajamaan_taksi/d59ca034c50995d6a77cacbe03e718de>
```

This concerns views, viewlets and portlet renderers. It will, for example, make the following code to fail:

```
self.obj = self.context.reference_catalog.lookupObject(value)
return self.obj.absolute_url() # Acquistion chain messed up, getPhysicalPath() fails
```

One workaround to avoid this mess is to use aq_inner when accessing self.obj values:
