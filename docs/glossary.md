    A JavaScript package that integrates with Volto's configuration registry and is able to enhance, extend, and customize it.

Add-on configuration loader (Volto)
    A function with signature `config => config`.
    It gets the Volto Configuration registry, and it must return it back after mutating it.
    It is similar to Generic Setup profiles in Plone Backend.
    An add-on must provide a default configuration loader that is always loaded when Volto runs.
    An add-on can have multiple configuration loaders, and they can be loaded optionally from the Volto configuration.

Configuration registry (Volto)
    A singleton object modeled using JavaScript modules.
    It is accessible from the Volto project by importing the module `@plone/volto/config` with `import registry from '@plone/volto/config'`.
    It contains the configuration of the Volto app.

Shadowing (Volto)
    Webpack provides an "alias" mechanism, where the path for a module can be aliased to another module.
    By using this mechanism Volto enables customization (file overrides), similar to `z3c.jbot.`

Razzle
    A tool that simplifies SPA and SSR configuration for React projects.

Webpack
    A tool that loads and bundles code and web resources using loaders.

Webpack entrypoint
    The main files generated by webpack as a result.
    They typically contain the application source code based on modules bundled together, but it can also include other resources, such as static resources.
    It can contain code to automatically trigger the load of other JavaScript code files called "chunks".

Babel

Express
    A JavaScript HTTP server with a simple API to build custom applications.
    Volto uses it as its server.

Single Page Application (SPA)
    A type of JavaScript application that aims to provide a better user experience by avoiding unnecessary reloading of the browser page, instead using AJAX to load backend information.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
    A development feature provided by Webpack that automatically reloads, in the browser, the JavaScript modules that have changed on disk.

Yeoman
    A popular scaffolding tool similar to Plone's `mr.bob` or `ZopeSkel`.

    A JavaScript package standard, the equivalent of a Python wheel or egg.
    Enables JavaScript modules.

    Also called "missdev", a tool similar to buildout's `mr.developer`.
    It automatically downloads and keeps up to date copies of software and add-ons under development based on definitions stored in `mrs.developer.json`.
    As a byproduct of its update operations, it also automatically adjusts `jsconfig.json`, which is used by Volto to configure webpack aliases.

Hydration (SSR)
    After loading an HTML page generated with SSR in the browser, React can "populate" the existing DOM elements, recreate and attach their coresponding components.

JSX
    A dialect of JavaScript that resembles XML, it is transpiled by Babel to JavaScript functions.
    React uses JSX as its component templating.

Scoped packages
    Namespace for JavaScript packages, they provide a way to avoid naming conflicts for common package names.

middleware (Redux)
    Custom wrappers for the Redux store dispatch methods.
    They allow customizing the behavior of the data flow inside the redux store.

hooks (React)
    Hooks are a React API that allow function components to use React features such as lifecycle methods, states, and so on.

hoisting (Yarn)
    An optimization provided by Yarn.
    By default JavaScript packages will directly include dependencies inside their local node_modules.
    By hoisting we're "lifting" these inner dependencies to the top level `node_modules` directory, and thus optimize the generated bundles.
    In case two dependencies have conflicting version dependencies of the same library, the hoisting will not be possible (for that conflicting dependency) and you'll see multiple instances of the same library in the bundle, or you'll see that the add-on receives its own `node_modules` folder.
