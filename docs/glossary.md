CSRF
Cross-Site Request Forgery
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of web attack that allows an attacker to send malicious requests to a web application on behalf of a legitimate user.
    The attack works by tricking the user's web browser into sending a request to the web application that the user did not intentionally make.
    This can allow an attacker to perform actions on the web application without the user's knowledge or consent.
    In Plone, CSRF protection is done almost transparently by [`plone.protect`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.protect/).

    Records are basic dictionaries.

Add-on
    An add-on in Plone extends its functionality.
    It is code that is released as a package to make it easier to install.

    In Volto, an add-on is a JavaScript package.

    In Plone core, an add-on is a Python package.

    -   [Plone core add-ons](https://github.com/collective/awesome-plone#readme)
    -   [Volto add-ons](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto#readme)
    -   [Add-ons tagged with the trove classifier `Framework :: Plone` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Plone)

Volto configuration loader
    A function with signature `config => config`.
    It gets the Volto configuration registry, and it must return it back after mutating it.
    It is similar to `GenericSetup` profiles in the Plone backend.
    An add-on must provide a default configuration loader that is always loaded when Volto runs.
    An add-on can have multiple configuration loaders, and they can be loaded optionally from the Volto configuration.

Configuration registry
    In Plone and in general, the configuration registry is where resources are registered for an application.

    In Volto, it is a singleton object modeled using JavaScript modules.
    It is accessible from the Volto project by importing the module `@plone/volto/config` with `import registry from '@plone/volto/config'`.
    It contains the configuration of the Volto app.

    In Plone core, [`plone.app.registry`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.registry/) provides Plone UI and `GenericSetup` integration for [`plone.registry`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.registry/), which in turn implements a configuration registry for Zope applications.

component shadowing
shadowing
    Volto uses a technique called component shadowing to override an existing Volto component with our local custom version, without having to modify Volto's source code.

    Volto's source components are located in the filepath stem of `omelette/src/components/`.
    Custom components that shadow Volto's source would be located in the filepath stem of `src/customizations/components/`.
    Shadow components would have the same filepath as Volto's source compenents, excluding the stem.
    Thus `omelette/src/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx` would be shadowed by `src/customizations/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx`.

    Webpack provides an alias mechanism that allows component shadowing in Volto, where the path for a module can be aliased to another module.
    By using this mechanism of file overrides, or component shadowing, Volto enables customization, similar to `z3c.jbot.`

Razzle
    A tool that simplifies {term}`SPA` and {term}`SSR` configuration for React projects.

Webpack
    A tool that loads and bundles code and web resources using loaders.

Webpack entrypoint
    The main files generated by webpack as a result.
    They typically contain the application source code based on modules bundled together, but it can also include other resources, such as static resources.
    It can contain code to automatically trigger the load of other JavaScript code files called "chunks".

Babel
    A JavaScript compiler that "transpiles" newer standards JavaScript to something that any browser can load.

Express
    A JavaScript HTTP server with a simple API to build custom applications.
    Volto uses it as its server.

SSR
server-side rendering
    When a web browser or other HTTP client sends a request, the HTML markup for the page is created on the server, which sends a response consisting of HTML markup back to the client.

    In Volto, SSR returns HTML markup that closely matches the final {term}`DOM` structure of the React components used to render that page, but it is not the complete page.
    After the client loads the initial response, then the {term}`hydration` mechanism performs additional rendering on the client side, populating the DOM with additional HTML markup.

    In Classic UI, SSR returns the complete page back to the client in the response.
    In some rare cases, additional HTML snippets may be loaded, such as in overlays or dialogs.

    SSR enables a developer to customize a website per request and per user.
    In addition, SSR can improve performance and search engine optimization (SEO) for a website.

DOM
Document Object Model
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
    It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
    The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages, such as JavaScript and React, can interact with the page.

SPA
single page application
    A type of JavaScript application that aims to provide a better user experience by avoiding unnecessary reloading of the browser page, instead using {term}`AJAX` to load backend information.

HMR
hot module replacement
    [Hot module replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/) (HMR) is a development feature provided by Webpack that automatically reloads, in the browser, the JavaScript modules that have changed on disk.

Ajax
AJAX
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    AJAX allows web applications to change parts of the page dynamically without reloading the entire page.
    In Plone, after a page with JavaScript is loaded, the JavaScript will send an asynchronous request to the server.
    The server will send a response back to the client, which is then rendered on the client side.

Yeoman
    [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) is a popular scaffolding tool similar to Plone's `mr.bob` or `ZopeSkel`.

CommonJS
    A JavaScript package standard, the equivalent of a Python wheel or egg.
    Enables JavaScript modules.

Transpilation
    The transformation of JavaScript code that uses advanced language features, unavailable for some browsers, to code rewritten to support them.

ES6
    ECMAScript 6, a newer version of the JavaScript language.

mrs-developer
    Also called "missdev", a tool similar to buildout's `mr.developer`.
    It automatically downloads and keeps up to date copies of software and add-ons under development based on definitions stored in `mrs.developer.json`.
    As a byproduct of its update operations, it also automatically adjusts `jsconfig.json`, which is used by Volto to configure webpack aliases.

Yarn
    [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a JavaScript package manager.

Hydration
    After loading an HTML page generated with {term}`SSR` in the browser, React can populate the existing {term}`DOM` elements, and recreate and attach their coresponding components.

JSX
    A dialect of JavaScript that resembles XML, it is transpiled by Babel to JavaScript functions.
    React uses JSX as its component templating.

Scoped packages
    Namespace for JavaScript packages, they provide a way to avoid naming conflicts for common package names.

Redux
Redux middleware
    Custom wrappers for the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store dispatch methods.
    They allow customizing the behavior of the data flow inside the Redux store.

hook
hooks
    In general, a hook in programming is a place in code that allows you to tap in to a module to either provide different behavior or to react when something happens.

    **React [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)** are a React API that allow function components to use React features, such as lifecycle methods, states, and so on.

hoisting
    [Hoisting](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon#hoisting) is an optimization provided by Yarn.
    By default JavaScript packages will directly include dependencies inside their local `node_modules`.
    By hoisting we're "lifting" these inner dependencies to the top level `node_modules` directory, and thus optimize the generated bundles.
    In case two dependencies have conflicting version dependencies of the same library, the hoisting will not be possible (for that conflicting dependency) and you'll see multiple instances of the same library in the bundle, or you'll see that the add-on receives its own `node_modules` folder.

React
    [React](https://www.reactjs.dev/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Volto, the frontend for Plone 6, uses React.

Sphinx
    [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.
    It was originally created for Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.
    Sphinx uses {term}`reStructuredText` as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, {term}`Docutils`.

Docutils
    [Docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) is an open-source text processing system for processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, man-pages, OpenDocument, or XML.

Markdown
    [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

fence
    A method to extend basic MyST syntax.
    You can define a directive with backticks (`` ` ``) followed by a reStructuredText directive in curly brackets (`{}`), and a matching number of closing backticks.
    You can also nest fences by increasing the number of backticks.

    `````md
    ````{warning}
    There be dragons!
    ```{important}
    Dragons have feelings, too!
    ```
    ````
    `````

    ````{warning}
    There be dragons!
    ```{important}
    Dragons have feelings, too!
    ```
    ````

Open Graph
    The [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.
    For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.

srcset
    The [`HTMLImageElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement) property `srcset` is a string which identifies one or more image candidate strings, separated using commas `,`.
    Each image candidate string specifies image resources to display in web pages under given circumstances.
