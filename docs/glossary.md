CSRF
Cross-Site Request Forgery
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of web attack that allows an attacker to send malicious requests to a web application on behalf of a legitimate user.
    The attack works by tricking the user's web browser into sending a request to the web application that the user did not intentionally make.
    This can allow an attacker to perform actions on the web application without the user's knowledge or consent.
    In Plone, CSRF protection is done almost transparently by [`plone.protect`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.protect/).

    Records are basic dictionaries.

Add-on
    An add-on in Plone extends its functionality.
    It is code that is released as a package to make it easier to install.

    In Volto, an add-on is a JavaScript package.

    In Plone core, an add-on is a Python package.

    -   [Plone core add-ons](https://github.com/collective/awesome-plone#readme)
    -   [Volto add-ons](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto#readme)
    -   [Add-ons tagged with the trove classifier `Framework :: Plone` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Plone)

Volto configuration loader
    A function with signature `config => config`.
    It gets the Volto configuration registry, and it must return it back after mutating it.
    It is similar to `GenericSetup` profiles in the Plone backend.
    An add-on must provide a default configuration loader that is always loaded when Volto runs.
    An add-on can have multiple configuration loaders, and they can be loaded optionally from the Volto configuration.

Configuration registry
    In Plone and in general, the configuration registry is where resources are registered for an application.

    In Volto, it is a singleton object modeled using JavaScript modules.
    It is accessible from the Volto project by importing the module `@plone/volto/config` with `import registry from '@plone/volto/config'`.
    It contains the configuration of the Volto app.

    In Plone core, [`plone.app.registry`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.registry/) provides Plone UI and `GenericSetup` integration for [`plone.registry`](https://pypi.org/project/plone.registry/), which in turn implements a configuration registry for Zope applications.

component shadowing
shadowing
    Volto uses a technique called component shadowing to override an existing Volto component with our local custom version, without having to modify Volto's source code.

    Volto's source components are located in the filepath stem of `omelette/src/components/`.
    Custom components that shadow Volto's source would be located in the filepath stem of `src/customizations/components/`.
    Shadow components would have the same filepath as Volto's source compenents, excluding the stem.
    Thus `omelette/src/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx` would be shadowed by `src/customizations/components/theme/Header/Header.jsx`.

    Webpack provides an alias mechanism that allows component shadowing in Volto, where the path for a module can be aliased to another module.
    By using this mechanism of file overrides, or component shadowing, Volto enables customization, similar to `z3c.jbot.`

Razzle
    A tool that simplifies {term}`SPA` and {term}`SSR` configuration for React projects.

Webpack
    A tool that loads and bundles code and web resources using loaders.

Webpack entrypoint
    The main files generated by webpack as a result.
    They typically contain the application source code based on modules bundled together, but it can also include other resources, such as static resources.
    It can contain code to automatically trigger the load of other JavaScript code files called "chunks".

Babel
    A JavaScript compiler that "transpiles" newer standards JavaScript to something that any browser can load.

Express
    A JavaScript HTTP server with a simple API to build custom applications.
    Volto uses it as its server.

SSR
server-side rendering
    When a web browser or other HTTP client sends a request, the HTML markup for the page is created on the server, which sends a response consisting of HTML markup back to the client.

    In Volto, SSR returns HTML markup that closely matches the final {term}`DOM` structure of the React components used to render that page, but it is not the complete page.
    After the client loads the initial response, then the {term}`hydration` mechanism performs additional rendering on the client side, populating the DOM with additional HTML markup.

    In Classic UI, SSR returns the complete page back to the client in the response.
    In some rare cases, additional HTML snippets may be loaded, such as in overlays or dialogs.

    SSR enables a developer to customize a website per request and per user.
    In addition, SSR can improve performance and search engine optimization (SEO) for a website.

DOM
Document Object Model
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
    It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
    The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages, such as JavaScript and React, can interact with the page.

SPA
single page application
    A type of JavaScript application that aims to provide a better user experience by avoiding unnecessary reloading of the browser page, instead using {term}`AJAX` to load backend information.

HMR
hot module replacement
    [Hot module replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/) (HMR) is a development feature provided by Webpack that automatically reloads, in the browser, the JavaScript modules that have changed on disk.

Ajax
AJAX
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    AJAX allows web applications to change parts of the page dynamically without reloading the entire page.
    In Plone, after a page with JavaScript is loaded, the JavaScript will send an asynchronous request to the server.
    The server will send a response back to the client, which is then rendered on the client side.

Yeoman
    [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) is a popular scaffolding tool similar to Plone's `mr.bob` or `ZopeSkel`.

CommonJS
    A JavaScript package standard, the equivalent of a Python wheel or egg.
    Enables JavaScript modules.

Transpilation
    The transformation of JavaScript code that uses advanced language features, unavailable for some browsers, to code rewritten to support them.

ES6
    ECMAScript 6, a newer version of the JavaScript language.

mrs-developer
    Also called "missdev", a tool similar to buildout's `mr.developer`.
    It automatically downloads and keeps up to date copies of software and add-ons under development based on definitions stored in `mrs.developer.json`.
    As a byproduct of its update operations, it also automatically adjusts `jsconfig.json`, which is used by Volto to configure webpack aliases.

Yarn
    [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is both a JavaScript package manager and project manager.

Corepack
    [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) is a zero-runtime-dependency Node.js script that acts as a bridge between Node.js projects and the package managers they are intended to be used with during development.
    In practical terms, Corepack lets you use {term}`Yarn`, {term}`npm`, and {term}`pnpm` without having to install them.

    Corepack is distributed by default with all recent Node.js versions.
    Run `corepack enable` to install the required Yarn and pnpm binaries on your path.

Git
    [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system.

Hydration
    After loading an HTML page generated with {term}`SSR` in the browser, React can populate the existing {term}`DOM` elements, and recreate and attach their coresponding components.

JSX
    A dialect of JavaScript that resembles XML, it is transpiled by Babel to JavaScript functions.
    React uses JSX as its component templating.

Scoped packages
    Namespace for JavaScript packages, they provide a way to avoid naming conflicts for common package names.

Redux
Redux middleware
    Custom wrappers for the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store dispatch methods.
    They allow customizing the behavior of the data flow inside the Redux store.

hook
hooks
    In general, a hook in programming is a place in code that allows you to tap in to a module to either provide different behavior or to react when something happens.

    **React [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)** are a React API that allow function components to use React features, such as lifecycle methods, states, and so on.

hoisting
    [Hoisting](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon#hoisting) is an optimization provided by Yarn.
    By default JavaScript packages will directly include dependencies inside their local `node_modules`.
    By hoisting we're "lifting" these inner dependencies to the top level `node_modules` directory, and thus optimize the generated bundles.
    In case two dependencies have conflicting version dependencies of the same library, the hoisting will not be possible (for that conflicting dependency) and you'll see multiple instances of the same library in the bundle, or you'll see that the add-on receives its own `node_modules` folder.

React
    [React](https://www.reactjs.dev/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Volto, the frontend for Plone 6, uses React.

Markdown
    [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

fence
    A method to extend basic MyST syntax.
    You can define a directive with backticks (`` ` ``) followed by a reStructuredText directive in curly brackets (`{}`), and a matching number of closing backticks.
    You can also nest fences by increasing the number of backticks.

    `````{example}
    ````{warning}
    There be dragons!
    ```{important}
    Dragons have feelings, too!
    ```
    ````
    `````

HTTP Request
Request
Requests
    The initial action performed by a web client to communicate with a server. The {term}`Request` is usually followed by a {term}`Response` by the server, either synchronous or asynchronous (which is more complex to handle on the user side)

HTTP-Response
HTTP Response
Response
    Answer of or action by the server that is executed or send to the client after the {term}`Request` is processed.

HTTP-Header
HTTP Header
Header
    The part of the communication of the client with the server that provides the initialisation of the communication of a {term}`Request`.

HTTP-Verb
HTTP Verb
Verb
    One of the basic actions that can be requested to be executed by the server (on an object) based on the {term}`Request`.

Object URL
    The target object of the {term}`Request`.

Authorization Header
    Part of the {term}`Request` that is responsible for the authentication related to the right user or service to ask for a {term}`Response`.

Accept Header
    Part of the {term}`Request` that is responsible to define the expected type of data to be accepted by the client in the {term}`Response`.

Authentication Method
    Access restriction provided by the connection chain to the server exposed to the client.

Basic Auth
    A simple {term}`Authentication Method` referenced in the {term}`Authorization Header` that needs to be provided by the server.

content rule
    A content rule will automatically perform an action when a certain event, known as a {term}`trigger`, takes place.

trigger
    A trigger is an event in Plone that causes the execution of defined actions.
    Example triggers include object modified, user logged in, and workflow state changed.

navigation root
    An object marked as a navigation root provides a way to root catalog queries, searches, breadcrumbs, and so on, into that object.

FTI
Factory Type Information
    Factory type information (FTI) is responsible for content creation in the portal.
    FTI is responsible for the following:

    -   Which function is called when new content type is added.
    -   Icons available for content types.
    -   Creation views for content types.
    -   Permission and security.
    -   Whether discussion is enabled.
    -   Providing the `factory_type_information` dictionary.
        This is used elsewhere in the code (often in `__init__.py` of a product) to set the initial values for a ZODB Factory Type Information object (an object in the `portal_types` tool).

    ```{seealso}
    [`FactoryTypeInformation` class source code](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.CMFCore/blob/361a30e0c72a15a21f88433b8d5fc49331f36728/src/Products/CMFCore/TypesTool.py#L431)
    ```

view
    A view is the basic element of modern Python web frameworks.
    A view runs code to set up Python variables for a rendering template.
    The output is not limited to HTML pages and snippets, but may contain {term}`JSON`, file download payloads, or other data formats.

traversal
    Traversal is the process of determining the object that is the target of a request by examining the URL path of the request or in code, and looking up objects in the object hierarchy.

acquisition
    Acquisition is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit attributes from their parent objects in the object hierarchy.

Varnish
    [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org) is a popular open source web accelerator that is used to implement HTTP caching.

Content Delivery Network
CDN
    A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers located in various geographic regions that work together to deliver web content to users quickly and efficiently.


unique identifier
UID
   UID is an acronym meaning "unique identifier".
   A UID is an identifier that is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for those objects and for a specific purpose.

pdb
    The Python Debugger module is an interactive source code debugger for Python programs. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

integer identifier
intid
    In Plone, an integer identifier, or intid, is used to uniquely identify content objects within a Plone site.
    Each content item in a Plone site is given a unique intid, which the system uses internally to reference content, keep track of link integrity, link translations, and other related purposes.

WSL
Windows Subsystem for Linux
    The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, or Arch Linux) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

pnpm
    [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a fast, disk space efficient package manager.

    In programming, a predicate is a test which returns `true` or `false`.

pnpm workspace
workspace
    pnpm has built-in support for monorepositories (also known as multi-package repositories, multi-project repositories, or monolithic repositories).
    Workspaces provide support to manage multiple packages from your local file system from within a singular top-level, root package.

    When you run `pnpm install` at the root of the repository, pnpm installs dependencies for all workspaces, ensuring consistency across the entire project.
    This centralized approach streamlines development, facilitates code sharing, and simplifies the maintenance of complex projects.

lazy load
lazy loading
lazy loaded
    Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed.
    It's a way to shorten the length of the [critical rendering path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path, which translates into reduced page load times.

reference implementation
    A reference implementation is a program that implements all requirements from a corresponding specification.
    The reference implementation often accompanies a technical standard, and demonstrates what should be considered the "correct" behavior of any other implementation of it.
