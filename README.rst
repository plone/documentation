One of the best ways to start contributing to the documentation is to pick one of the tickets labeled
`First Timer <https://github.com/plone/documentation/labels/First%20Timers>`_.

Please do not misinterpret ``First Timer`` as ``easy`` !

``First Timer`` does not always mean, that these tickets are suited for *beginner* or people who are new
to Plone.

For some of them you will need to know Python, Plone or Operating Systems.

Tickets labeled ``First Timer`` are excellent for your first contribution to the docs because,
these are accessible and straightforward.
