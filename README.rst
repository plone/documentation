You can read the documentation on `docs.plone.org <http://docs.plone.org>`_.

Contribute
==========

If you want to contribute please make sure to read:

- `Our documentation about contributing <https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/index.html>`_
- `Our docs style-guide <https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/documentation_styleguide.html>`_
- `Our reST style-guide <https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/rst-styleguide.html>`_

One of the best ways to start contributing to the documentation is to pick one of the tickets labeled
`First Timer <https://github.com/plone/documentation/labels/First%20Timers>`_.

Please do not misinterpret ``First Timer`` as ``easy`` !

``First Timer`` does not always mean that these tickets are suited for *beginners* or people who are new
to Plone.

For some of them you will need to know Python, Plone or Operating Systems.

Tickets labeled ``First Timer`` are excellent for your first contribution to the docs because,
these are accessible and straightforward.
