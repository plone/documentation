Skin Layers
===========

Templates, scripts, images, CSS and JavaScript files are organized with
skin layers.

    Note: in the context of components, "layer" has a slightly different
    meaning.

A skin is comprised of a series of skin layers. On the file system, each
layer is a directory. In the Zope Management Interface (ZMI), each layer
appears in portal\_skins as a separate folder (containing page
templates, style sheets or Python scripts).

These have two uses.

-  Firstly they keep things organized. If you take a look at the Plone
   Default Skin (part of which is shown in portal\_skins in the
   screenshot above) you'll see that they've separated out templates,
   scripts, styles and images into separate skin layers.
-  More importantly they have an order of precedence. This means that an
   item named main\_template in the top layer will be found and used
   before an item named main\_template in the bottom layer. We will go
   into this in more detail on the next page.

To create a skin layer through the web, simply add a new folder. On the
file system, add a directory to your skins directory. You will also need
to add a small amount of configuration to ensure that your directory is
found and registered as a skin layer on installation.

Firstly, in [your theme package]/skins.zcml

::

    <cmf:registerDirectory
           name="[Your Skin Directory Name]"/>

Next, in [your theme package]/profiles/default/skins.xml

::

    <object name="[Your Skin Directory Name]"
        meta_type="Filesystem Directory View"
        directory="[your namespace].[your theme name]:skins/[Your Skin Directory Name]"/>

and

::

    <skin-path name="[your skin name]" based-on="Plone Default">
      <layer name="[Your Skin Directory Name]"
         insert-after="custom"/>
     </skin-path>
