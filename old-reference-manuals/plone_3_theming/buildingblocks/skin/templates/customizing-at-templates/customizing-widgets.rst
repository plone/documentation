Customizing Widgets
===================

This page shows you how to customize widgets, and gives some examples of
what kinds of neat tricks can be done with widget customization.

As we've already said, widgets are what Archetypes uses to display
individual fields. Archetypes' built-in templates,
``base_view``,\ ``base``, and ``widgets/field`` use each field and the
field's associated widget (specified in the schema) to determine which
widget template to use. However, you can override a widget's template,
as we will show below. Furthermore, you can create a whole new widget
class, which will have data and operations specific to the display of
your custom data type. Read the next section to determine how much
widget hacking you need to do.

How to Determine If You Need to Create A Custom Widget Class
------------------------------------------------------------

If you cannot find a widget in Archetypes or in a readily-available
third-party product that does what you need, use the following set of
questions to determine if you can just customize the **template** versus
creating a new **widget class**. If you answer "no" to the following
questions, a custom template is all you need:

-  Does the display of your field require helper functions to do
   conversions or formatting that would be difficult or cumbersome in
   TALES?
-  Do you have multiple AT-based classes where some fields in those
   classes share all of the the following characteristics?

   -  The same data type
   -  Similar, needs for display
   -  One or more attributes that are class-specific that apply to the
      display (i.e. the most appropriate place to set these attributes
      is in the schema definition)

-  Does your custom data type need some super-specific marshalling when
   edited or searched that you can't get from any standard AT widget
   class?
-  Do you need to override or change the way that Archetypes handles the
   processing of the ``edit`` form for a particular field?

If you answered yes to most of the questions, then you might need to
create a Widget class. If the questions aren't clear, take a look at the
`RichDocument tutorial <http://plone.org/tutorial/richdocument>`_ . If
you've got a specific enough use-case (like RichDocument) that you
*need* custom widget classes, you're probably able to make it happen
just by the sheer fact that you *know* you need them.

Customizing Widget Templates
----------------------------

Creating custom widget templates is not hard, so don't be afraid. I
assume if you're reading this far, you've already determined that you
don't need a custom widget class, and just need to tinker a little bit
with how things are done by default.

First, you should understand what you have control over by customizing a
widget template itself. You're controlling the display of the widget's
*data*, but not its *label*. For a StringField called ``myfield``, the
default display is something like:

**myfield:** some value

The only thing we can control is the display of what comes after
"**myfield:**\ ", which is just the data contained within the field
itself (we'll talk about how to customize the display of labels later).
However, if we customize the template, we can insert *all kinds* of
nifty HTML into there! Take a look at the default template for
StringWidget, 'widget/string'. It's pretty straight-forward. As you can
see, there are three important macros in a widget template:

-  ``view``
-  ``edit``
-  ``search``

Widget templates must define all three macros, however we can pass-through
to the default when we aren't customising.

Don't concern yourself with the ``edit`` and ``search`` macros;
remember, we're customizing the *view*. Let's start by creating a new
skin template called ``my_string_widget``. Start with this:

::

        <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
              xmlns:tal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal"
              xmlns:metal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/metal"
              xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
              i18n:domain="plone">

          <head><title></title></head>

          <body>

            <metal:define define-macro="view">
              <metal:use use-macro="context/widgets/string/macros/view">
                <metal:fill fill-slot="inside">
                   <span tal:content="accessor">Content</span>
                   <span>is the coolest field data ever!</span>
                </metal:fill>
              </metal:use>
            </metal:define>

            <metal:define define-macro="edit">
              <metal:block use-macro="context/widgets/string/macros/edit" />
            </metal:define>

            <metal:define define-macro="search">
              <metal:block use-macro="context/widgets/string/macros/search" />
            </metal:define>

          </body>

        </html>

(NB: I'm breaking AT's naming convention here. You don't have to do that,
but I find it more convenient and understandable to add a ``_widget`` to
the names of my widget templates)

Notice we didn't copy the definitions for ``edit`` or ``search``, we also
get the default template to generate the markup surrounding the view widget,
and just populate the ``inside`` macro.

Also, notice how there is no display code for the label; that's handled
elsewhere. If you're wondering where the ``accessor`` variable comes
from, that's part of the widget display code. The widget class defines
the following local variables that are accessible inside widget
templates:

``accessor``
    The accessor method for the field. Call it to retrieve the value of
    the field.
``fieldName``
    The name of the field.
``widget``
    The widget object for the field.
``field``
    The instance of the field class itself.
``mode``
    Will be ``view`` or ``edit``, based on the action being taken. For
    our purposes, it should always be ``view``.

Now, let's modify the way that our StringField displays. For brevity,
I'll just show the ``view`` macro:

Then, we should tell our type's schema to point at the new template,
by setting ``macro``:

::

        StringField('myfield',
            widget=StringWidget(
                label='Myfield',
                label_msgid='ATViewTutorial_label_myfield',
                description_msgid='ATViewTutorial_help_myfield',
                i18n_domain='ATViewTutorial',
                macro='my_string_widget',
            )
        ),

Be sure to restart Zope and reinstall using ``portal_quickinstaller``.
Now, our StringField, when rendered, looks like this:

.. figure:: /old-reference-manuals/plone_3_theming/images/customwidget.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: Custom Widget

   Custom Widget

Yes, folks, it's *just that easy*.
