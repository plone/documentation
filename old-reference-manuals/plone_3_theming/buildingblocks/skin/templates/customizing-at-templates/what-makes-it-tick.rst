What Makes It Tick?
===================

This page describes how Archetypes uses different templates to generate
HTML, and how AT-based template customization can be applied.

Archetypes has a very clever system for generating HTML pages for
AT-based objects. The same set of templates generates **all** of the
content areas for **all** AT-based objects. This buys you the following
benefit, useful for site consistency:

-  All the pages look the same.

However, it also has the following drawback:

-  All the pages look the same.

Different types of content need to be displayed differently. Let's dig
into how Archetypes does things, so we can figure out how to make your
content types *shine*!

The ``base_view`` Template
--------------------------

The ``base_view`` template (found in the archetypes skin) handles
selecting the appropriate macros from the appropriate templates, and
using those macros to display content objects. If you look at this piece
of code from 'base\_view':

::

            <tal:block define="portal_type python:here.getPortalTypeName().lower().replace(' ', '_');
                               view_template python:'%s_view' % portal_type;
                               view_macros python:path('here/%s/macros|nothing' % view_template);
                               macro view_macros/css | nothing"
                       condition="macro">

You can see that it defines the variable ``view_template`` as the
object's Portal Type Name converted to lowercase, with spaces replaced
with underscores (\_), followed by ``_view``. So, MyType's view
template, for instance, would be called ``mytype_view``.

Now, before we move on, I must warn you: don't edit ``base_view``.
Seriously.
Don't.\ `[1] <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/buildingblocks/skin/templates/customizing-at-templates/what-makes-it-tick#ref1>`_

No, really. Don't customize ``base_view``. If you think you need to
customize ``base_view``, first, well... don't. Keep reading the
tutorial. If you're certain, after reading the tutorial, that you need
to customize ``base_view``, again, **don't!** Write a clear, concise
example indicating why, after reading this tutorial, you believe you
should customize ``base_view``, and send it to the ``archetypes-users``
mailing list. If you *really do* need to customize ``base_view``, you've
found a shortcoming in Archetypes, and the people on the list will
inform you if that's the case. So, repeat after me: "Don't customize
``base_view``." Good!

Now, there are six important macros to be aware of. These six macros
give you the power to insert template code that is customized for your
class. These macros are:

``js``
    A macro to insert javascript into the ``<head>`` tag of the
    generated HTML page
``css``
    A macro to insert CSS includes and style code into the ``<head>``
    tag of the page
``header``
    The macro that defines the topmost portion of the content area. By
    default, this macro has an ``<h1>`` tag that contains the title, and
    links for printing, emailing, etc. on the right.
``body``
    The macro that defines the "body" area of the content. This is where
    the fields and their values are displayed.
``folderlisting``
    This macro shows a list of the child content for the object. Don't
    confuse this with ``folder_contents``, this is what the ``view`` tab
    shows for folderish objects. Folderish objects use both the ``body``
    macro and the ``folderlisting`` macro.
``footer``
    This is where AT puts the byline.

   This image shows the areas generated by the header, body, and
   folderlisting macros

As you can see, the ``header`` macro generates what's outlined in the
area marked ''header'' in red, the ``body`` macro generates the content
just beneath it, and the ``folderlisting`` macro generates the listing
of the objects within the folderish object.

The ``base_view`` template automatically pulls the appropriate macro
from the custom view template (``mytype_view``, from our earlier ad-hoc
example), or from the next template that we are going to explore:
``base``.

The ``base`` Template
---------------------

The ``base`` template contains four of the six macros that ``base_view``
looks for:

-  ``header``
-  ``body``
-  ``folderlisting``
-  ``footer``

The only reason why I mention ``base`` is so that you know where AT's
default behavior comes from. This is important if you only want to
change a little bit of a type's view. It's often helpful to copy the
macro from ``base`` into your custom view template, and then start
tweaking and customizing.

Widgets
-------

Widgets are what Archetypes uses to display fields. Widgets have two
parts:

The widget class
    This class defines data and behavior for the widget. In most cases,
    you'll never need to create a custom 'Widget'-derived class. See
    Archetypes/Widget.py for examples.
The widget template
    This is a ZPT that provides three macros: ``view``, ``edit``, and
    ``search``. These macros display the field. Some of the macros
    depend on certain variables being defined in the calling template,
    so pay close attention. Most often, you'll only need to provide a
    custom widget template, and not a custom widget class.

There are all kinds of widgets out there to do all kinds of things. The
`Archetypes Quick Reference
Manual <http://plone.org/products/archetypes/documentation/manual/quickref>`_
covers the details for the various widgets in Archetypes.
