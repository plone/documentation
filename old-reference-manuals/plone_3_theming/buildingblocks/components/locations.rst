Where to find what you need
===========================

Where to put components in your own product and how to track them down
in the Zope Management Interface and on the file system.

Through the Web
---------------

The templates for most components can be customized through the web:

-  Site Setup > Zope Management Interface > portal\_view\_customizations

The :doc:`Elements </old-reference-manuals/plone_3_theming/elements/index>`
section can help you identify the component you need.

Plone Default Components on the File system
-------------------------------------------

If you're planning to wire up your own components, you may need to track
down the relevant files of existing components to copy. This can be
tricky. They are packaged up into a number of different eggs, so you
need first to locate where your eggs are stored, and then work out which
of these contains the component elements you need.

-  To work out where your eggs are stored, look at the :doc:`Where is what </old-reference-manuals/plone_3_theming/whereiswhat/index>`
   section of this manual?
-  The :doc:`Elements </old-reference-manuals/plone_3_theming/elements/index>`
   section of this manual will help you track down the egg containing
   the component you need.

In your own Theme Product
-------------------------

 |The browser folder in your theme product|/browser/viewlet.py \|

viewlet.pt
    An example viewlet component
/browser/interfaces.py
    This is used to create your theme interface
/profiles/default/viewlets.xml
    Use this file to order your viewlets within viewlet managers
/browser/configure..zcml
    Use this file to wire up your components
/browser/templates \| styles
    These directories can be used for templates, styles, and images. You
    will need to register these as directories as resources in
    configure.zcml
