Creating a simple feedback form
=================================

.. admonition:: Description

  This section explains how to create a very basic feedback form.


.. note::

  The code for this example is available to checkout from the
  collective as `the *example.formlib* package
  <http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/example.formlib/>`_.

For all practical sense formlib based components are really regular
Zope view components with some convenient base classes for
auto-generating output based on schemas and other configuration
info. You will see that in a moment.

First, define an interface class with the schema of the form:

::

    from zope.interface import Interface
    from zope.schema import TextLine, Text

    class IFeedbackForm(Interface):
        """
        A typical feedback schema
        """
        customer = TextLine(title=u'Customer',
                          description=u'Customer email',
                          required=True)

        subject = TextLine(title=u'Subject',
                           required=True)

        message = Text(title=u'Message',
                       description=u'The message body',
                       required=True)

The purpose of this interface is to define the fields of the form.
The type of each schema field determines the type of widget that
will be used by default for that field, so choose it carefully. To
see all the schema fields available, read the zope.schema package's
interfaces.

Next, create a form instance, which is a class that groups an
ordered collection of fields and actions. To do that, simply
subclass Five's PageForm class, a wrapper to the formlib Form class
to keep Zope 2 happy. Type the following code into a Python file
inside your product:

::

    from five.formlib.formbase import PageForm

You will also need to make use of Five's strange hybrid between
Zope 2 and Zope 3 page templates:

::

    from Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile import ViewPageTemplateFile

The simplest way to define a collection of form fields is using the
``Fields`` constructor with the previous schema:

::

    from zope.formlib import form

    class FeedbackForm(PageForm):
        """
        A typical feedback form
        """
        form_fields = form.Fields(IFeedbackForm)

By inheriting from the ``PageForm`` class, the ``FeedbackForm``
class inherit functionality from formlib itself. By default,
``PageForm`` knows how to generate all the HTML that will make up
of a finished form. But in order to do this, formlib needs to know
what fields are wanted. This is done by providing the form\_fields
attribute. The ``Fields`` constructor is a formlib helper class
that generates the appropriate field items from any Zope 3 schema
(in this case, the schema interface defined above).

In order to provide a complete form, you need to specify the action
to perform when the "submit" button of the form (or any other
indicated) is activated. To define the action, use the
``form.action`` decorator with a handler function for the submitted
data. More on actions later.

::

    # use a dummy MailHost tool here to keep it simple
    class MHost:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
        def Send(self, sender, to, subject, body):
            pass

    class FeedbackForm(PageForm):
        """
        A typical feedback form
        """
        form_fields = form.Fields(IFeedbackForm)
        result_template = ViewPageTemplateFile('feedback_result.pt')

        @form.action("send")
        def action_send(self, action, data):
            mhost = MHost()
            self.mFrom = data['customer']
            self.mTo = "feedback@mycompany.com"
            self.mSubject = data['subject']
            self.mBody = data['message']
            mhost.Send(self.mFrom, self.mTo, self.mSubject, self.mBody)
            return self.result_template()

This is where the real work takes place. In this example, the
``feedback_result.pt`` page template is rendered and returned. All
the view's attributes will be available inside this template, which
will be introduced later.

An example result form is:

::

    <html metal:use-macro="context/@@standard_macros/view">

    <head>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div metal:fill-slot="body">
            <h1 tal:content="view/label">Form label</h1>
            <p>Thank you for your request about
            <span tal:replace="view/mSubject">subject</span>,
            <span tal:replace="view/mFrom">customer@mail</span>.</p>
            <p>We will reply to it shortly.</p>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

zope.formlib already includes a default general page form template,
with the fields labels, the widgets structures and the submit
buttons, so you only have to register your form page with the
appropiate ZCML snippet in order to make it accesible from a
browser. Assuming you've placed your code into a file named
``browser.py``:

::

    <browser:page
            name="feedback"
            for="Products.CMFPlone.Portal.PloneSite"
            class=".browser.FeedbackForm"
            permission="zope.Public"
            />

Let's explain what this ZCML snippet means:

-  The ``for`` attribute indicates the class or interface this view
   will be available for; in this case, it will be shown only from the
   root of a Plone site. To see the interfaces provided by a certain
   object, fire up the ZMI, navigate up to your object and check the
   Interfaces tab.
-  The ``name`` attribute sets the name of the view, so the form
   will be available from a URL with the form
   ``http://<plone-site>/feedback``.
-  The ``class`` attribute indicates the view class responsible for
   displaying the page form, in this case, the FeedbackForm class
   inside the ``browser.py`` file.
-  The ``permission`` attribute specify the permission needed to
   access the page.

Among the most used permissions you can find:


-  ``zope.Public`` - no restrictions, available to everyone.
-  ``zope.View`` - permission to view this component.
-  ``zope.ManageContent`` - add, edit and delete content objects.

    Note: Keen readers will notice the special name for configuring the
    new view component, browser:page. This XML tag actually employs an
    XML namespace prefix which needs to be defined. Normally this is
    added right onto the configure tag like this:

    ::

        <configure
            xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
            xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
            xmlns:five="http://namespaces.zope.org/five">


And that's all! Here's how the form and result pages will look
like:
